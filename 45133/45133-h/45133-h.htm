<h2>THE HELPERS</h2>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> curtain had gone down on the first act of
the opera, and Jeffard found his hat and rose to go
out. His place was the fourth from the aisle, and
after an ineffectual attempt to make a passageway
for him without rising, the two young women and
the elderly man stood up and folded their opera
chairs. Being driven to think pointedly of something
else, Jeffard neglected to acknowledge the
courtesy; and the two young women balanced the
account by discussing him after he had passed out
of hearing.</p>

<p>"I think he might at least have said 'Thank
you,'" protested the one in the black-plumed picture-hat,
preening herself after the manner of ruffled
birds and disturbed womankind. "I'm in love with
your mountains, and your climate, and your end-of-the-century
impetus, but I can't say that I particularly
admire Denver manners."</p>

<p>The clear-eyed young woman in the modest toque
laughed joyously.</p>

<p>"Go on, Myra dear; don't mind me. It's so
refreshing to hear an out-of-church opinion on one's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
self. I know our manners are perfectly primitive,
but what can you expect when every train from the
East brings us a new lot of people to civilize?
When you are tempted to groan over our shortcomings
it'll comfort you wonderfully if you will
just stop long enough to remember that a good
many of us are the newest of new tenderfoots!"</p>

<p>"Tenderfoots! What an expression!"</p>

<p>"It's good English, though we did use to say
'tenderfeet' before the 'Century Dictionary' set us
right. And it calls the turn, as poppa would say."</p>

<p>She of the far-reaching plumes bent her eyebrows
in severe deprecation.</p>

<p>"Connie, your slang is simply vicious. Will you
be good enough to tell me what 'calls the turn'
means?"</p>

<p>"Ask poppa."</p>

<p>Appealed to by the censorious one, the elderly
man stopped twiddling the bit of gold quartz on his
watch-guard long enough to explain. He did it with
a little hesitancy, picking his way among the words
as one might handle broken glass, or the edged tools
of an unfamiliar trade. He was a plain man, and
he stood in considerable awe of the picture-hat and
its wearer. When he had finished, the toque made
honorable amends.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Myra. Really, I didn't
know it had anything to do with gambling. But
to go back to our manners: I'll give you the
ponies and the phaeton if I don't convince you that
the absent-minded gentleman on our left here is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
the tenderest of tenderfoots&mdash;most probably from
Philadelphia, too," she added, in mischievous afterthought.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't dare!"</p>

<p>"You think not? Just wait and you'll see.
Oh, cousin mine, you've a lot to learn about your
kind, yet. If you stay out here six months or a
year, you will begin to think your philosophy hasn't
been half dreamful enough."</p>

<p>"How absurd you are, Constance. If I didn't
know you to be"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wait a minute; let me start you off right:
good, and sensible, and modest, and unassuming,
and dutiful, and brimful of fads"&mdash;she checked
the attributes off on her fingers. "You see I have
them all by heart."</p>

<p>The little cloud of dust puffing from beneath the
drop-curtain began to subside, and the thumping
and rumbling on the stage died away what time the
musicians were clambering back to their places in
the orchestra. Miss Van Vetter swept the aisles
and the standing-room with her opera-glass.</p>

<p>"You will not have a chance to prove it, Connie.
He isn't coming back."</p>

<p>"Don't you believe it. I am quite sure he is a
gentleman who always gets the worth of his money."</p>

<p>"What makes you say that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know; intuition, I suppose. That's
what they call it in a woman, though I think it
would be called good judgment in a man."</p>

<p>Taking him at his worst, Miss Elliott's terse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
characterization of Henry Jeffard was not altogether
inaccurate, though, in the present instance,
he would not have gone back to the theatre if he
had known what else to do with himself. Indeed,
he was minded not to go back, but a turn in the
open air made him think better of it, and he
strolled in as the curtain was rising. Whereupon
the elderly man and the two young women had to
stand again while he edged past them to his chair.</p>

<p>This time he remembered, and said something
about being sorry to trouble them. Miss Elliott's
chair was next to his, and she smiled and nodded
reassuringly. Jeffard was moody and disheartened,
and the nod and the smile went near to the better
part of him. He kept his seat during the next intermission,
and ventured a civil commonplace about
the opera. The young woman replied in kind, and
the wheel thus set in motion soon rolled away from
the beaten track of trivialities into a path leading
straight to the fulfillment of Miss Elliott's promise
to her cousin.</p>

<p>"Then you haven't been long in Denver," she
hazarded on the strength of a remark which betrayed
his unfamiliarity with Colorado.</p>

<p>"Only a few weeks."</p>

<p>"And you like it? Every one does, you know."</p>

<p>Jeffard tried to look decorously acquiescent and
made a failure of it.</p>

<p>"I suppose I ought to be polite and say yes; but
for once in a way, I'm going to be sincere and say
no."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>"You surprise me! I thought everybody, and
especially new-comers, liked Denver; enthusiastically
at first, and rather more than less afterward."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I am the exception," he suggested,
willing to concede something. "I fancy it depends
very much upon the point of view. To be brutally
frank about it, I came here&mdash;like some few hundreds
of others, I presume&mdash;to make my fortune;
and I think I would better have stayed at home. I
seem to have arrived a decade or two after the fact."</p>

<p>The young woman never swerved from her intention
by a hair's-breadth.</p>

<p>"Yes?" she queried. "It's too true that these
are not the palmy days of the 'Matchless' and the
'Little Pittsburg,' notwithstanding Creede and
Cripple Creek. And yet it would seem that even
now our Colorado is a fairer field for ambition and
energy than"&mdash;</p>

<p>She paused, and Jeffard, with an unanalyzed impression
that it was both very singular and very
pleasant to be talking thus freely with a self-contained
young woman whose serenity was apparently
undisturbed by any notions of conventionality, said,
"Than a city of the fifth class in New England, let
us say. Yes, I concede that, if you include ambition;
but when it comes to a plain question of earning
a living"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, as to that," she rejoined, quite willing to
argue with him now that her point was gained, "if
it is merely a question of getting enough to eat and
drink I suppose that can be answered anywhere.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Even the Utes managed to answer it here before
the Government began feeding them."</p>

<p>He regarded her curiously, trying to determine
her social point of view by the many little outward
signs of prosperity which tasteful simplicity, unhampered
by a lean purse, may exhibit.</p>

<p>"I wonder if you know anything at all about it,"
he said, half musingly.</p>

<p>"About getting something to eat?" Her laugh
was a ripple of pure joy that had the tonic of the
altitudes in it. "I dare say I don't&mdash;not in any
practical way; though I do go about among our
poor people. That is what makes me uncharitable.
I can't help knowing why so many people have to
go hungry."</p>

<p>Jeffard winced as if the uncharity had a personal
application.</p>

<p>"We were speaking of fortunes," he corrected,
calmly ignoring the fact that his own remark had
brought up the question of the struggle for existence.
"I think my own case is a fair example of
what comes of chasing ambitious phantoms. I gave
up a modest certainty at home to come here, and"&mdash;The
musicians were taking their places again, and he
stopped abruptly.</p>

<p>"And now?" The words uttered themselves, and
she was sorry for them when they were beyond
recall.</p>

<p>His gesture was expressive of disgust, but there
was no resentment in his reply.</p>

<p>"That was some time ago, as I have intimated;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
and I am still here and beginning to wish very
heartily that I had never come. I presume you can
infer the rest."</p>

<p>The leader lifted his baton, and the curtain rose
on the third act of the opera. At the same moment
the curtain of unacquaintance, drawn aside a hand's-breadth
by the young woman's curiosity, fell between
these two who knew not so much as each
other's names, and who assumed&mdash;if either of
them thought anything about it&mdash;that the wave of
chance which had tossed them together would presently
sweep them apart again.</p>

<p>After the opera the ebbing tide of humanity did
so separate them; but when the man had melted
into the crowd in the foyer, the young woman had a
curious little thrill of regret; a twinge of remorse
born of the recollection that she had made him open
the book of his life to a stranger for the satisfying
of a mere whim of curiosity.</p>

<p>Miss Van Vetter was ominously silent on the way
home, but she made it a point of conscience to go
to Constance's room before her cousin had gone to
bed.</p>

<p>"Connie Elliott," she began, "you deserve to be
shaken! How did you dare to talk with that young
man without knowing the first syllable about him?"</p>

<p>Constance sat down on the edge of the bed and
laughed till the tears came.</p>

<p>"Oh, Myra dear," she gasped, "it's worth any
amount of disgrace to see you ruffle your feathers
so beautifully. Don't you see that I talked to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
just because I didn't know any of the syllables?
And he told me a lot of them."</p>

<p>"I should think he did. I suppose he will call
on you next."</p>

<p>Connie the unconventional became Miss Elliott
in the smallest appreciable lapse of time. "Indeed,
he will not. He knows better than to do that, even
if he is a ten&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Miss Van Vetter was gone.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Jeffard left the theatre he went to his
room; but not directly. He made a detour of a
few squares which took him down Sixteenth Street
to Larimer, and so on around to his lodging, which
was in the neighborhood of the St. James hotel.</p>

<p>After the manner of those whose goings and comings
have reached the accusative point, he took the
trouble to assure himself that the burning of a cigar
in the open air was the excuse for the roundabout
walk; but the real reason showed its head for a
moment or two when he slackened his pace at one
point in the circuit and glanced furtively up at a
row of carefully shaded windows in the second story
of a building on the opposite side of the street.</p>

<p>The lower part of the building was dark and deserted;
but in the alley there was a small hallway
screened by a pair of swing doors with glass eyes
in them, and at the end of the hallway a carpeted
stair leading up to the lighted room above. It was
to keep from climbing this stair that Jeffard had
gone to the theatre earlier in the evening.</p>

<p>Opposite the alley he stopped and made as if he
would cross the street, but the impulse seemed to
expend itself in the moment of hesitation, and he
went on again, slowly, as one to whom dubiety has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
lent its leaden-soled shoes. Reaching his room he
lighted the gas and dropped into a chair, his hands
deep-buried in his pockets, and a look of something
like desperation in his eyes.</p>

<p>The suggestive outline of his Western experience
sketched between the acts of the opera for the
young woman with the reassuring smile was made
up of half-truths, as such confidences are wont to
be. It was true that he had come to Colorado to
seek his fortune, and that thus far the quest had
been bootless. But it was also true that he had
begun by persuading himself that he must first
study his environment; and that the curriculum
which he had chosen was comprehensive, exhaustive,
and costly enough to speedily absorb the few
thousand dollars which were to have been his lure
for success.</p>

<p>His walk in life hitherto had been decently irreproachable,
hedged in on either hand by such good
habits as may be formed by the attrition of a moral
community; but since these were more the attributes
of time and place than of the man, and were
unconsciously left behind in the leave-takings, a
species of insanity, known only to those who have
habitually worn the harness of self-restraint, had
come upon him in the new environment. At first
it had been but a vagrant impulse, and as such he
had suffered it to put a bandage on the eyes of reason.
Later, when he would fain have removed the
bandage, he found it tied in a hard knot.</p>

<p>For the hundredth time within a month he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
once more tugging at the knot. To give himself
the benefit of an object-lesson, he turned his pockets
inside out, throwing together a small heap of loose
silver and crumpled bank-notes on the table. After
which he made a deliberate accounting, smoothing
the creases out of the bills, and building an accurate
little pillar with the coins. The exact sum
ascertained, he sat back and regarded the money
reflectively.</p>

<p>"Ninety-five dollars and forty-five cents. That's
what there is left out of the nest-egg; and I've
been here rather less than four months. At that
rate I've averaged, let me see"&mdash;he knitted his
brows and made an approximate calculation&mdash;"say,
fifty dollars a day. Consequently, the mill will run
out of grist in less than two days, or it would if the
law of averages held good&mdash;which it doesn't, in
this case. Taking the last fortnight as a basis, I'm
capitalized for just about one hour longer."</p>

<p>He looked at his watch and got up wearily.
"It's Kismet," he mused. "I might as well take
my hour now, and be done with it." Whereupon
he rolled the money into a compact little bundle,
turned off the gas, and felt his way down the dark
stair to the street.</p>

<p>At the corner he ran against a stalwart young
fellow, gloved and overcoated, and carrying a valise.</p>

<p>"Why, hello, Jeffard, old man," said the traveler
heartily, stopping to shake hands. "Doing time on
the street at midnight, as usual, aren't you? When
do you ever catch up on your sleep?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>Jeffard's laugh was perfunctory. "I don't have
much to do but eat and sleep," he replied. "Have
you been somewhere?"</p>

<p>"Yes; just got down from the mine&mdash;train was
late. Same old story with you, I suppose? Haven't
found the barrel of money rolling up hill yet?"</p>

<p>Jeffard shook his head.</p>

<p>"Jeff, you're an ass&mdash;that's what you are; a
humpbacked burro of the Saguache, at that! You
come out here in the morning of a bad year with a
piece of sheepskin in your grip, and the Lord knows
what little pickings of civil engineering in your
head, and camp down in Denver expecting your
lucky day to come along and slap you in the face.
Why don't you come up on the range and take hold
with your hands?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I'll have to before I get through,"
Jeffard admitted; and then: "Don't abuse me to-night,
Bartrow. I've about all I can carry."</p>

<p>The stalwart one put his free arm about his
friend and swung him around to the light.</p>

<p>"And that isn't the worst of it," he went on,
ignoring Jeffard's protest. "You've been monkeying
with the fire and getting your fingers burned;
and, as a matter of course, making ducks and
drakes of your little stake. Drop it all, Jeffard,
and come across to the St. James and smoke a cigar
with me."</p>

<p>"I can't to-night, Bartrow. I'm in a blue funk,
and I've got to walk it off."</p>

<p>"Blue nothing! You'll walk about two blocks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
more or less, and then you'll pull up a chair and
proceed to burn your fingers some more. Oh, I
know the symptoms like a book."</p>

<p>Jeffard summoned his dignity, and found some
few shreds and patches of it left. "Bartrow, there
is such a thing as overdrawing one's account with a
friend," he returned stiffly. "I don't want to quarrel
with you. Good-night."</p>

<p>Three minutes later the goggle-eyed swing doors
opened and engulfed him. At the top of the carpeted
stair he met a hard-faced man who was doubling
a thick sheaf of bank-notes into portable shape.
The outgoer nodded, and tapped the roll significantly.
"Go in and break 'em," he rasped. "The
bank's out o' luck to-night, and it's our rake-off.
I win all I can stand."</p>

<p>Jeffard pushed through another swing door and
went to the faro-table. Counting his money he
dropped the odd change back into his pocket and
handed the bills to the banker.</p>

<p>"Ninety-five?" queried the man; and when Jeffard
nodded, he pushed the requisite number of
blue, red, and white counters across the table. Jeffard
arranged them in a symmetrical row in front of
him, and began to play with the singleness of purpose
which is the characteristic of that particular
form of dementia.</p>

<p>It was the old story with the usual variations.
He lost, won, and then lost again until he could
reckon his counters by units. After which the tide
turned once more, and the roar of its flood dinned in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
his ears like the drumming of a tornado in a forest.
His capital grew by leaps and bounds, doubling,
trebling, and finally quadrupling the sum he had
handed the banker. Then his hands began to
shake, and the man on his right paused in his own
play long enough to say, "Now's yer time to cash
in, pardner. Yer nerve's a-flickerin'."</p>

<p>The prudent advice fell upon deaf ears. Jeffard's
soul was Berserk in the fierce battle with chance,
and he began placing the counters upon certain of
the inlaid cards before him, stopping only when he
had staked his last dollar. Five minutes afterward
he was standing on the sidewalk again, drawing in
deep breaths of the keen morning air, and wondering
if it were only the possession of the thing called
money that kept one's head from buzzing ordinarily.
In the midst of the unspoken query the shuffling
figure of a night tramp sidled up to him, and he
heard imperfectly the stereotyped appeal.</p>

<p>"Hungry, you say? Perhaps I'll be that, myself,
before long. Here you are."</p>

<p>The odd change jingled into the outstretched
palm of the vagrant, and for the first time in a
fairly industrious life Jeffard knew what it felt like
to be quite without money.</p>

<p>"That is, I think I do, but I don't," he mused,
walking slowly in the direction of his room. "It
isn't breakfast-time yet; and by the same token,
it isn't going to be for a good while. I believe I
can sleep the clock around, now that I've reached
the bottom."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> one has sown the wind, and the whirlwind
harvest is begun, it is easy to imagine that the first
few strokes of the sickle have gathered in all the
bitterness there is in the crop. Some such illusory
assumption lent itself to Jeffard's mood when he
assured himself that he had finally reached the bottom;
but the light of a new day, and a habit of
early rising which was not to be broken at such
short notice, brought a clearer perspective.</p>

<p>In lieu of breakfast he walked up one street and
down another, carefully avoiding the vicinity of the
St. James for fear Bartrow might offer him hospitality,
and dodging the haunts of his few acquaintances
in the downtown thoroughfares for the same
reason. This drove him to the residence district;
and out in Colfax Avenue he met the elderly man
whom he had taken to be the father of the young
woman with the kindly nod and smile.</p>

<p>Seeing him in daylight, Jeffard recognized a
familiar figure of the Mining Exchange and the
brokers' offices, and thought it not unlikely that he
might presently stumble upon the home of the
young woman. He found it a square or two farther
out, identifying it by a glimpse of the young woman
herself, who was on the veranda, looping up the tendrils
of a climbing rose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>At sight of her Jeffard forgot his penalties for
the moment, and the early morning sunshine seemed
to take on a kindlier glow. She was standing on
the arm of a clumsy veranda-chair, trying vainly to
reach the higher branches of the rose, and Jeffard
remarked that she was small almost to girlishness.
But the suggestion of immaturity paused with her
stature. The rounded arms discovered by the loose
sleeves of her belted house-gown; the firm, full outline
of her figure; the crowning glory of red-brown
hair with the heart of the sunlight in it; the self-contained
poise on the arm of the great chair; these
were all womanly, and the glimpse stirred the waters
of a neglected pool in Jeffard's past as he went on
his aimless way along the avenue.</p>

<p>There was a closely written leaf in the book of
memory which he had sought to tear out and destroy;
but the sight of the graceful figure poised on
the arm of the big chair opened the record at the
forbidden page, and the imagined personality of the
sweet-faced young woman with the red-brown hair
and sympathetic eyes set itself antithetically over
against the self-seeking ambition of the girl who had
written her own epitaph in the book of his remembrance.
He gave place to the sharply defined contrast
for a time, indulging it as one who plunges not
unwillingly into the past for the sake of escaping
the present, and banishing it only when his shortening
shadow gave token that the chance of a breakfast
invitation was no longer to be apprehended.</p>

<p>But when he turned his face cityward it was with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
a conscious avoidance of the route which would lead
him past the house with a climbing rose on one of
its veranda pillars. For what had a man to whom
the proletary's highway was already opening up its
cheerless vista to do with love, and dalliance, and
heaven-suggestive pictures of domestic beatitude?</p>

<p>Once more in Sixteenth Street, the moneyless
reality thrust itself upon him with renewed insistence,
and he turned a corner abruptly to escape an
acquaintance who was crossing the street. The
shame of it was too new to strike hands with dissimulation
as yet, and companionship was least of all
things to be desired. If he could but win back to
his room unaccosted and lock himself in until the
sharpness of hunger should have exorcised the devil
of humiliation, he might hope to be able to face an
accusing world with such equanimity as may be born
of desperation.</p>

<p>But fate willed otherwise. As he was passing a
deep-set doorway giving on the sidewalk, a friendly
arm shot out and barred the way. Jeffard looked
up with an unspoken malediction on his tongue. It
was Bartrow. In his haste to gain his lodging the
shamed one had forgotten the proximity of the St.
James hotel.</p>

<p>"You're a chump!" declared the broad-shouldered
young miner, backing Jeffard against the wall
and pinning him fast with one finger. "You're no
man's man, and you're not fit to live in a man's
town. Why didn't you come around to breakfast
this morning, like decent people?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm not boarding at the St. James now." Jeffard
tried to say it naturally, but the evasion was
palpable enough.</p>

<p>"What of that? Couldn't you afford to be sociable
once in a way?"</p>

<p>Jeffard prevaricated, and since he was but a
clumsy liar, contrived to fall into a snare of his own
setting.</p>

<p>"I was up too early for you, I guess. When I
came by, the clerk told me you weren't down yet."</p>

<p>Bartrow shook his head and appeared to be much
moved.</p>

<p>"What an abnormal liar that clerk must be," he
commented reflectively. "I asked him five minutes
ago if any one had inquired for me, and he said no."</p>

<p>Jeffard hung his head and would have tried to
break away; but Bartrow locked arms with him and
dragged him whither he would.</p>

<p>"I'll forgive you this time," he went on, laughing
at Jeffard's discomfiture. "I suppose you had
your reasons for dodging, and while it's ten to one
they were no good, that leaves one chance in your
favor. Have a smoke?"</p>

<p>Now Jeffard's poverty-pride was fire-new as yet,
and though the smell of Bartrow's cigar made him
faint with desire, he refused the gift.</p>

<p>"Haven't quit, have you?" Bartrow demanded.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;yes; that is, I have for the present.
I'm not feeling very well this morning."</p>

<p>"You look it; every inch of it. Let's go around
and see what the money people are doing. Maybe
that'll chirk you up a bit."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>Jeffard yielded, partly because Bartrow's impetus
was always of the irresistible sort, and partly because
he could think of no plausible objection on the
spur of the moment. Bartrow talked cheerily all the
way around to the Mining Exchange, telling of his
claims and prospects in Chaffee County, and warming
to his subject as only a seasoned Coloradoan can
when the talk is of "mineral" and mining. Jeffard,
being hungry, and sick with a fierce longing for
tobacco, said little, and was duly thankful that Bartrow
required no more than a word now and then
to keep him going. None the less he watched narrowly
for a chance to escape, and was visibly depressed
when none offered.</p>

<p>In the crowded Exchange the poverty-pride began
to lose the fine keenness of its edge. The atmosphere
of the room was pungent with cigar smoke,
and the tobacco craving rose up in its might and
smote down Jeffard's self-respect.</p>

<p>"If you'll excuse me a minute, Dick, I believe I'll
go out and get a cigar as a measure of self-defense,"
he said; and Bartrow supplied his need, as a matter
of course. It was a shameful subterfuge, and he
loathed himself for having descended to it. Nevertheless,
he took the cigar which Bartrow made haste
to offer, and lighted it. The first few whiffs made
him dizzy, but afterward he was better company for
the enthusiast.</p>

<p>While they were talking, the elderly man with
the bit of quartz on his watch-chain came in, and
Jeffard inquired if Bartrow knew him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>"Know Steve Elliott? I should say I do.
Everybody knows him, barring now and then a tenderfoot
like yourself. Besides being one of the
most lovable old infants on top of earth, he's one of
Denver's picturesques. That old man has had more
ups and downs than any three men in Colorado; and
that's saying a good deal."</p>

<p>"In what way?"</p>

<p>"Oh, every way. He's a Fifty-niner, to begin
with; came across the plains in a bull-train to hunt
for mineral. He found it&mdash;Steve would find it if
anybody could&mdash;but some sharp rascal euchred
him out of it, and he's been finding it and losing it
at regular intervals ever since."</p>

<p>Jeffard blew a cloud of smoke toward the ceiling,
and took in the outward presentment of the pioneer
in an appraisive eye-sweep. "This is one of the
finding intervals, I take it."</p>

<p>"Sure. He's on top just now,&mdash;rather more
so than usual, I believe,&mdash;but the 'pioneer's luck'
will catch him again some day, and just as likely as
not he'll be hustling around for a grub-stake."</p>

<p>"Man of family?" queried Jeffard.</p>

<p>"Yes, if a daughter's a family. His wife died
in one of the lean years a long time ago. But say,
Jeffard, you ought to know the daughter. She's as
pretty as a peach, and as bright as a new nickel.
She's had her share of the ups and downs, and
they've made a queer little medley of her. Trap
and tandem and a big house on Capitol Hill one
month, and as like as not two rooms in a block and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
a ride in the street-cars the next. That's about
the way Connie Elliott's had it all her life, and it's
made her as wide awake as a frosty morning, and
as good as a Sister of Charity."</p>

<p>"I can believe all that," Jeffard admitted, meaning
more than he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, you're safe in believing all the good things
you hear about Steve Elliott and his daughter.
They're good people. By the way, why can't you
come up to the house with me some evening and
get acquainted? They've a Philadelphia cousin
staying with them now, and you might compare
notes on the 'wild and woolly' with her."</p>

<p>Jeffard had a string of excuses ready, ending
with, "Besides, there are particular reasons why I
don't wish to meet Miss Elliott just now&mdash;reasons
that I can't explain."</p>

<p>"Reasons be hanged! Just you stand still a
minute while I go get the old man and introduce
you. You'll like him a whole lot."</p>

<p>Bartrow did his part, but by the time he had
pulled Elliott out of the throng in front of the
quotation board, Jeffard was two squares away,
headed once more for the suburbs. This time he
crossed the river and tramped for hours in the
Highlands. He told himself he was killing time
and keeping out of the way of the luncheon hour; but
in reality he was fighting a desperate battle with
pride, or self-respect, or whatever it is that makes
a man who is not a born vagrant shrink from that
species of cannibalism which begins with the eating
of one's personal possessions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>It was an unequal fight at best, since hunger was
the besieger, but Jeffard made shift to prolong it
until the long day of fasting was drawing to its
close. He yielded at last, as needs must when famine
drives, but the capitulation was upon conditions,
and his heart was soft with repentant kneadings.
Since one must eat to live, the pride-quenching thing
must come to pass; but the doing of it should be
the pivot upon which he would turn back to sanity
and industrious thrift. The loss of his small patrimony
and the hard-earned savings by which it had
been fairly doubled was shrewd upon him, but he
told himself that the consequences of his folly must
be set over against the experience; that he must be
content to begin again at the bottom, as his father
had before him, thankful for the youth and strength
which made such a beginning possible.</p>

<p>From the preliminary survey of penitence to
plotting out the map of good intentions is an easy
stage, and Jeffard beguiled the long tramp townward
by building air-castles spacious and many-storied,
with the new resolutions for their foundations. But
when the sidewalks of the streets were once more
under his feet, the pride-quenching necessity urged
itself afresh, plying the lash of shame until he was
driven to tramp yet other squares before he could
attain to the plunging point.</p>

<p>He was passing the Albany when the climax was
reached, and he turned aside to get a light for the
carefully economized stump of Bartrow's cigar before
setting out to find a pawnshop where his pride might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
suffer least. At the cigar counter in the rotunda a
giant in rough tweeds, with an unshorn beard and
the fine bronze of the grazing plains on face and
hands, was filling his case with high-priced Cubans
from an open box. At sight of Jeffard he dropped
the cigar-case and roared out a mighty welcome.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be &mdash;&mdash;! Jeffard, my boy, where
under the canopy did you drop from? If I haven't
had a search-warrant out for you all day, I'm a liar
and the truth has shook me. Been to dinner?&mdash;but
of course you haven't; or if you have, you are
going to eat another with me right now. How've
you been? and where in Tophet have you been
hiding out?"</p>

<p>Jeffard smiled. "That's the place&mdash;in Tophet
and elsewhere; but I haven't been out of town
since you were here last."</p>

<p>"The devil you haven't! Then what did that
muley maverick at the hotel mean when he said you
were gone?"</p>

<p>"Gone from the hotel, I guess he meant. I've
been 'eating around,' as we used to say back in the
Berkshire Hills."</p>

<p>"Have, eh? Well, you're going to 'eat around'
with me to-night, savez? I was just going to swear
a few lines and go up and eat by myself. Come on;
let's get a move. I've got a train-load of steers on
the iron, and I'm due to chase 'em at eight-thirty.
But before I forget it, here"&mdash;the big man found
a compact little wad of bank-notes in his vest pocket
and thrust it into Jeffard's hand. "I counted that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
out the next morning and meant to give it back to
you, but the thing got away from me slick and
clean."</p>

<p>"Give it back to me?" queried Jeffard, with a
sudden swelling of the throat that made his voice
husky and tremulous, "what is it?"</p>

<p>"Why, it's the hundred I borrowed of you the
last time we took in the menagerie together. What's
the matter with you? Don't tell me you don't
remember it, or I shall go kick myself around the
block for an over-honest idiot!"</p>

<p>Jeffard did not remember it; could but dimly
recall the circumstances now that he was reminded
of them. The lending had been in a moment of
supreme excitement in the midst of a feverish attack
of the dementia; the loan was in celluloid counters,
in fact, and not in legal tender at all. And having
been made, it was swiftly lost sight of in the varying
fortunes of the sitting. None the less, the
return of it at the precise moment when it was most
needed drove the thankfulness to his eyes, and the
lights of the great rotunda swam in a misty haze
when he thought of the humiliating thing from
which the small Providence had saved him.</p>

<p>"Pettigrew," he said, when he could trust himself
to speak, "you're an honest man, and that's the
worst that can be said of you. I had forgotten it
long ago. Take me in and fill me up. I've been
tramping all day, and it runs in my mind that I've
skipped a meal or two."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> dancing party at the Calmaines' was a crush,
as Mrs. Calmaine's social enlargements were wont
to be. For an hour or more the avenue had been
a-rumble with carriages coming and going, and a
trickling stream of bidden ones flowed steadily inward
under the electric-lighted awning, which extended
the welcome of the hospitable house to the
very curb.</p>

<p>Thanks to Myra Van Vetter, whose tiring was
always of the most leisurely, the Elliotts were fashionably
late; and the elderly man, with the hesitant
air accentuated by the unwonted dress-coat, had
much ado to win through the throng in the drawing-rooms
with his charges. His greeting to the hostess
was sincere rather than well-turned in its phrasing;
but Mrs. Calmaine was sweetly gracious.</p>

<p>"<i>So</i> glad to see you, Stephen," she protested;
"the old friends can never be spared, you know."
She shook hands with unaffected cordiality, and her
tactful use of the elderly man's Christian name
went far toward effacing the afflictive dress-coat.
"Miss Van Vetter, you are quite radiant to-night.
You spoil all one's ideals of Quaker demureness."</p>

<p>"Oh, Myra's demure enough, only you have to
be her country cousin to find it out," put in Connie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
maliciously; and when her father and Miss Van
Vetter had made room for later comers, she waited
for another word with the hostess.</p>

<p>"Just a hint, before I'm submerged," she began,
when her opportunity came. "I'm unattached, and
particularly good-natured and docile to-night. Make
use of me just as you would of Delia or Bessie.
You've everybody here, as usual, and if I can help
you amuse people"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thank you, Connie, dear; that is very sweet of
you. There are people here to-night who seem not
to belong to any one. Here comes one of them
now."</p>

<p>Constance looked and saw a young man making
his way toward them; a soldierly figure, with square
shoulders and the easy bearing of one who has lived
much in the open; but with a face which was rather
thoughtful than strong, though its lines were well
masked under a close-trimmed beard and virile
mustaches. She recognized her unintroduced acquaintance
of the theatre; and a minute or two
afterward, when Mrs. Calmaine would have presented
the new-comer, Miss Elliott had disappeared.</p>

<p>"Let's sit down here, Teddy; this is as good a
place as any. You poor boy! it bores you dreadfully,
doesn't it? How trying it must be to be <i>blasé</i> at&mdash;shall
I say twenty? or is it twenty-one?"</p>

<p>The dancing was two hours old, and Connie and
the smooth-faced boy who stood for the hopes of the
house of Calmaine were sitting out the intermission
on a broad step of the main stair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I'm young, but I'll outgrow that," rejoined
the youth tolerantly. "All the same, you needn't
bully me because you've a month or two the advantage.
Shall I go and get you something to eat, or
drink?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you, Teddy; I'm neither hungry nor
thirsty. But you might give me the recipe for being
good-natured when people make game of you."</p>

<p>"Yes; I think I see myself giving you points on
that," said the boy, with frank admiration in his eyes.
"I'm not running an angel-school just at present."</p>

<p>Connie's blush was reproachful. "You ridiculous
boy!" she retorted. "You'll be making love to me
next, just the same as if we hadn't known each other
all our lives. Do you talk that way to other girls?
or are you only practicing on me so that you can?"</p>

<p>Teddy Calmaine shook his head. "There isn't
anybody else," he asserted, with mock earnestness.
"My celestial acquaintance is too limited. When
the goddess goes, there are no half-goddesses to take
her place."</p>

<p>Connie sniffed sympathetically, and then laughed
at him. "You ought to have seen me yesterday,
when poppa brought old Jack Hawley home with
him. Poppa and Jack were partners in the 'Vesta,'
and Mr. Hawley hadn't seen me since I was in pinafores.
He called me 'little girl,' and wanted to
know if I went to school, and how I was getting
along!"</p>

<p>Young Calmaine made a dumb show of applause.
"<i>O umbræ Pygmæorum!</i> Why wasn't I there to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
see! But you mustn't be too hard on old Jack.
Half the people here who don't know you think
you're an escaped schoolgirl; I've heard 'em. That's
why I took pity on you and"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Teddy Calmaine, go away and find me somebody
to talk to; a grown man, if you please. You
make me tired."</p>

<p>The boy got up with a quizzical grin on his
smooth face. "I'll do it," he assented affably;
"I'm no end good-natured, as you remarked a few
minutes ago."</p>

<p>When he was gone Connie forgot him, and fell
into a muse, with the sights and sounds of the crush
for its motive. From her perch on the stair she
could look down on the shifting scene in the wide
entrance hall, and through the archway beyond she
had a glimpse of the circling figures in the ball-room
swaying rhythmically to the music. It was all very
delightful and joyous, and she enjoyed it with a zest
which was yet undulled by satiety. None the less, the
lavishness of it oppressed her, and a vague protest,
born of other sights and scenes sharply contrasted
but no less familiar to the daughter of Stephen
Elliott, began to shape itself in her heart. How
much suffering a bare tithe of the wealth blazing
here in jewels on fair hands and arms and necks
would alleviate. And how many hungry mouths
might be filled from the groaning tables in the
supper-room.</p>

<p>Miss Elliott came out of her reverie reluctantly
at the bidding of her late companion. Teddy Calmaine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
had obeyed her literally; and when she turned
he was presenting the soldierly young man with the
pointed beard and curling mustaches.</p>

<p>"Miss Elliott, this is Mr. Jeffard. You said you
wanted a"&mdash;</p>

<p>"An ice, Teddy," she cut in, with a look which
was meant to be obliterative. "But you needn't
mind it now. Will you have half a stair-step, Mr.
Jeffard?"</p>

<p>She made room for him, but he was mindful of
his obligations.</p>

<p>"Not if you will give me this waltz."</p>

<p>She glanced at her card and looked up at him
with a smile which was half pleading and half quizzical.
"Must I?"</p>

<p>He laughed and sat down beside her. "There is
no 'must' about it. I was hoping you would refuse."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you."</p>

<p>"For your sake rather than my own," he hastened
to add. "I am a wretched dancer."</p>

<p>"What a damaging admission!"</p>

<p>"Is it? Do you know, I had hoped you wouldn't
take that view of it."</p>

<p>"I don't," she admitted, quite frankly. "We
take it seriously, as we do most of our amusements,
but it's a relic of barbarism. Once, when I was a
very little girl, my father took me to see a Ute scalp-dance,&mdash;without
the scalps, of course,&mdash;and&mdash;well,
first impressions are apt to be lasting. I never
see a ball-room in action without thinking of Fire-in-the-Snow
and his capering braves."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>Jeffard smiled at the conceit, but he spoke to the
truism.</p>

<p>"I hope your first impressions of me won't be
lasting," he ventured. "I think I was more than
usually churlish last night."</p>

<p>She glanced up quickly. "There should be no
'last night' for us," she averred.</p>

<p>"Forgive me; you are quite right. But no matter
what happens there always will be."</p>

<p>Her gaze lost itself among the circling figures beyond
the archway, and the truth of the assertion
drove itself home with a twinge of something like
regret. But when she turned to him again there
was unashamed frankness in the clear gray eyes.</p>

<p>"What poor minions the conventions have made
us," she said. "Let us be primitive and admit that
our acquaintance began last night. Does that help
you?"</p>

<p>"It will help me very much, if you will let me
try to efface the first impression."</p>

<p>"Does it need effacing?"</p>

<p>"I think it must. I was moody and half desperate."</p>

<p>He stopped, and she knew that he was waiting
for some sign of encouragement. She looked away
again, meaning not to give it. It is one of the little
martyrdoms of sympathetic souls to invite confidences
and thereby to suffer vicariously for the
misdoings of the erring majority, and her burdens
in this wise were many and heavy. Why should
she go out of her way to add to them those of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
man who ought to be abundantly able to carry his
own? Thus the unspoken question, and the answer
came close upon the heels of it. But for her own
curiosity,&mdash;impertinence, she had begun to call it,&mdash;the
occasion would never have arisen.</p>

<p>"I am listening," she said, giving him his sign.</p>

<p>Being permitted to speak freely, Jeffard found
himself suddenly tongue-tied. "I don't know what
I ought to say,&mdash;if, indeed, I ought to say anything
at all," he began. "I think I gave you to understand
that the world had been using me rather
hardly."</p>

<p>"And if you did?"</p>

<p>A palpitant couple, free of the waltz, came up
the stair, and Jeffard rose to make way. When
the breathless ones perched themselves on the landing
above, he went on, standing on the step below
her and leaning against the baluster.</p>

<p>"If I did, it was an implied untruth. It's a
trite saying that the world is what we make it, and
I am quite sure now that I have been making my
part of it since I came to Denver. I'm not going
to afflict you with the formula, but I shall feel better
for having told you that I have torn it up and
thrown it away."</p>

<p>"And you will write out another?"</p>

<p>"Beginning with to-morrow. I leave Denver in
the morning."</p>

<p>"You are not going back?" She said it with a
little tang of deprecation in the words.</p>

<p>His heart warmed to the small flash of friendly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
interest, and he smiled and shook his head. "No,
that would never do&mdash;without the fortune, you
know. I'm going to the mountains; with pick
and shovel, if need be. I should have started to-night
if I hadn't found Mrs. Calmaine's invitation.
She has been very good to me in a social way, and
I could do no less than come." He said it apologetically,
as if the dip into the social pool on the eve
of the new setting forth demanded an explanation.</p>

<p>She smiled up at him. "Does it need an apology?
Are you sorry you came?"</p>

<p>"Sorry? It's the one wise thing I've done
these four months. I shall always be glad&mdash;and
thankful." It was on his tongue to say more; to
dig the pit of confession still deeper, as one who,
finding himself at the shrine of compassionate
purity, would be assoilzied for all the wrong-doings
and follies and stumblings of a misguided past;
to say many things for which he had no shadow of
warrant, and to which the self-contained young
woman on the step before him could make no possible
rejoinder; but the upcoming of the man whose
name stood next on Connie's card saved him. A
moment later he was taking his leave.</p>

<p>"Not going to break away now, are you, Jeffard?"
said the fortunate one, helping Connie to
rise.</p>

<p>"Yes; I must cut it short. I leave town in the
morning. Miss Elliott, will you bid me Godspeed?"</p>

<p>She put her hand in his and said what was meet;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
and to the man who stood beside her the parting
appeared to be neither more nor less than conventionally
formal. But when Jeffard was free of the
house and swinging along on his way cityward, the
spirit of it made itself a name to live; and out of
the God-speed and the kindly phrase of leavetaking
the new-blown fire of good intention distilled a
subtle liqueur of jubilance which sang in his veins
like the true wine of rejuvenescence; so nearly may
the alchemy of pure womanhood transmute sounding
brass, or still baser metal, into the semblance of
virgin gold.</p>

<p>So Jeffard went his way reflective, and while he
mused the fire burned and he saw himself in his
recent stumblings in the valley of dry bones as a
thing apart. From the saner point of view it
seemed incredible that he could ever have been the
thrall of such an ignoble passion as that which had
so lately despoiled him and sent him to tramp the
streets like a hungry vagrant. As yet the lesson
was but a few hours old, but the barrier it had
thrown up between the insensate yesterday and the
rational to-day seemed safely impassable. In the
strength of reinstated reason, confidence returned;
and close upon the heels of confidence, temerity.
His reverie had led him past the corner where he
should have turned westward, and when he took
cognizance of his surroundings he was standing
opposite the alley-way of the glass-eyed doors. He
glanced at his watch. It was midnight. Twenty-four
hours before, almost to the minute, he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
been dragged irresistibly across the street and up
the carpeted stair to the lair of the dementia-demon.</p>

<p>He looked up at the carefully shaded windows,
and a sudden desire to prove himself came upon
him. Not once since the first hot flashes of the
fever had begun to quicken his pulse, had he been
able to go and look on and return scathless. But
was he not sane now? and was not the barrier well
builded? If it were not&mdash;if it stood only upon the
lack of opportunity&mdash;</p>

<p>He crossed the street and threaded the narrow
alley, tramping steadily as one who goes into battle,&mdash;a
battle which may be postponed, but which may
by no means be evaded. The swing doors gave
back under his hand, and a minute later he stood
beside the table with the inlaid cards in its centre,
his hands thrust deep in his pockets, and his breath
coming in sharp little gasps.</p>

<p>It was a perilous moment for any son of Adam
who has been once bitten by the dog of avarice
gone mad. The run of luck was against the bank,
and the piles of counters under the hands of the
haggard ones girdling the table grew and multiplied
with every turn of the cards. Jeffard's lips
began to twitch, and the pupils of his eyes narrowed
to two scintillant points. Slowly, and by almost
imperceptible advances, his right hand crept from
its covert, the fingers tightly clenched upon the
small roll of bank-notes,&mdash;the Providential windfall
which must provision any future argosy of
endeavor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>The dealer ran the cards with monotonous precision,
his hands moving like the pieces of a nicely
adjusted mechanism. Jeffard's fingers unclosed and
he stood staring down at the money in his palm as
if the sight of it fascinated him. Then he turned
quickly and tossed it across to the banker. "Reds
and whites," he said; and the sound of his own
voice jarred upon his nerves like the rasping of files
in a saw-pit.</p>

<p>Two hours later, he was again standing on the
narrow footway in the alley, with the swing doors
winging to rest behind him. Two hours of frenzied
excitement in the dubious battle with chance, and
the day of penitence and its hopeful promise for
the future were as if they had not been. Halfway
across the street he turned and flung his clenched
fist up at the shaded windows, but his tongue clave
to his teeth and the curse turned to a groan with a
sob at the end of it. And as he went his way, sodden
with weariness, the words of a long-forgotten
allegory were ringing knell-like in his ears:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man,
he walketh in dry places seeking rest, and findeth
none. Then he saith, I will return into my house
from whence I came out; and when he is come, he
findeth it empty and swept and garnished. Then
goeth he and taketh with him seven other spirits
more wicked than himself, and they enter in and
dwell there; and the last state of that man is worse
than the first."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was on the day following the dancing party at
the Calmaines' that Constance Elliott arrayed herself
in a modest street dress, and ran down to the library
where Miss Van Vetter was writing letters.</p>

<p>"You'd better change your mind, Myra, and
come along with me. It'll do you good to see how
the other half lives," she said coaxingly.</p>

<p>Miss Van Vetter calmly finished her sentence before
she replied.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Connie; but I believe not. I know
it is the proper fad nowadays to go slumming, but I
can't do it; it's a matter of principle with me."</p>

<p>Connie's eyebrows arched in mild surprise.
"That's a new one," she commented. "I've heard
all kinds of excuses, but never that. How do you
diagram it?"</p>

<p>"It is simple enough. One sees plenty of misery
in the ordinary course of things without making a
specialty of looking for it; and when you've done
everything that your money and sympathy can do,
it is only a single drop in the great ocean of human
wretchedness, after all. More than that, you have
added to the sum total of the world's suffering by
just so much as the miseries of the others hurt you
through your compassion."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>"Myra, dear, if I didn't know that you are better
than your theories, I should try to humble you.
What will you do if the evil day ever comes to
you?"</p>

<p>"Unload my woes upon some such angelic and
charitable sister of mercy as you are, I suppose,"
rejoined Miss Van Vetter complacently. "But that
doesn't make it necessary for me to go about and
shed literal tears with those who weep, now. I prefer
to do it by proxy." She took a gold piece from
her purse and offered it to Constance. "Take this,
and make some poor wretch comfortable for ten or
fifteen minutes on my account."</p>

<p>Miss Elliott was not yet canonized, and she refused
the contribution with an indignant little stamp
of her foot. "Myra Van Vetter, you're worse than
a heathen! I wouldn't touch your money with the
tip of my finger; I'd be afraid it would burn me.
I hope you'll learn for yourself some day what the
cold shoulder of charity is&mdash;there!" And she
swept out of the room with as much dignity as five-feet-one-and-a-half
may compass upon extraordinary
occasions.</p>

<p>Once on the other side of the library door, she
laughed softly to herself and was instantly Connie
the serene again.</p>

<p>"It does me a whole lot of good to boil over once in
a while," she said, going out on the veranda. "Myra
serves one beneficent end in the cosmogony in spite
of herself: she's a perfect safety-valve for me.
Tommie-e-e-e! O Tom! Are you out there?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>A ragged boy, sitting on the curb and shaking
dice with a pair of pebbles, sprang up and ran to
the gate. When the latch baffled him, as it usually
did from the outside, he vaulted the fence and stood
before her.</p>

<p>"Prompt as usual, aren't you, Tommie?"</p>

<p>"Ain't got nothin' else to do but to be promp'.
Is it a baskit, dis time, 'r wot?"</p>

<p>"It's a basket, and you'll find it in the kitchen."</p>

<p>Five minutes later the dwellers in the avenue
might have seen a small procession headed townwards.
Its component parts were a dainty little
lady, walking very straight with her hands in the
pockets of her jacket, and a ragged urchin bent sidewise
against the weight of a capacious basket.</p>

<p>The street-car line was convenient, but Constance
walked in deference to Tommie's convictions,&mdash;he
objected to the car on the score of economy.
"Wot's the use o' givin' a bloated corp'ration a
nickel w'en a feller can mog along on his feets?"
he had demanded, one day; and thereafter they
walked.</p>

<p>What profits it to set down in measured phrase at
what numbers in what streets the basket cover was
lifted that afternoon? Doubtless, in that great day
when the books shall be opened, it will be found
that a faithful record has been kept, not only of the
tumbler of jelly left with bedridden Mother M'Garrihan,
the bottle of wine put into the hands of gaunt
Tom Devins, who was slowly dying of lead-poisoning,
and the more substantial viands spread out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
before the hungry children in drunken Owen David's
shanty, but of all the other deeds of mercy that left
a trail of thankful benisons in the wake of the small
procession. Be it sufficient to say that the round
was a long one, and that Constance spared neither
herself nor her father's bank-account where she
found misery with uplifted hands.</p>

<p>The basket had grown appreciably lighter, and
Tommie's body was once more approaching the perpendicular,
when the procession paused before an
unswept stairway leading to the second story of a
building fronting on one of the lower cross streets.
Constance held out her hand for the basket, but the
boy put it behind him.</p>

<p>"Wot's the matter with me?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Nothing at all, Tommie. I only meant to save
you a climb. The basket isn't heavy now, you
know."</p>

<p>"S'posin' it ain't; ain't I hired to run this end
o' the show? You jes' tell me where you want it
put, an' that's right where I'm goin' to put it, an'
not nowheres else."</p>

<p>She smiled and let him lead the way up the dusty
stair. At a certain door near the end of the long
upper corridor she signed to him to give her the
basket. "Go to the head of the stairs and wait,"
she whispered. "I may want you."</p>

<p>When he was out of hearing she tapped on the
door and went in. It was the interior of all others
that made Constance want to cry. There was a
sufficiency of garish furniture and tawdry knickknacks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
scattered about to show that it was not the
dwelling-place of the desperately poor; but these
were only the accessories to the picture of desolation
and utter neglect having for its central figure the
woman stretched out upon the bed. She was asleep,
and her face was turned toward the light which
struggled feebly through the unwashed window.
Beauty there had been, and might be again, but not
even the flush of health would efface the marks of
Margaret Gannon's latest plunge into the chilling
depths of human indifference. Connie tiptoed to
the bedside and looked, and her heart swelled within
her.</p>

<p>It had fallen out in this wise. On the Monday
night Mademoiselle Angeline&mdash;known to her intimates
as Mag Gannon&mdash;saw fuzzy little circles
expand and contract around the gas-jets in the
Bijou Theatre while she was walking through her
part in the farce. Tuesday night the fuzzy circles
became blurs; and the stage manager swore audibly
when she faltered and missed the step in her specialty.
On the Wednesday Mademoiselle Angeline
disappeared from the Bijou altogether; and for
three days she had lain helpless and suffering, seeing
no human face until Constance came and ministered
to her. And the pity of it was that while the
fever wrought its torturous will upon her, delirium
would not come to help her to forget that she was
forgotten.</p>

<p>Constance had pieced out the pitiful story by fragments
while she was dragging the woman back from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
the brink of the pit; and when all was said, she
began to understand that a sick soul demands other
remedies than drugs and dainties. Just what they
were, or how they were to be applied, was another
matter; but Constance grappled with the problem
as ardently as if no one had ever before attacked
it. In her later visits she always brought the conversation
around to Margaret's future; and on the
afternoon of the basket-procession, after she had
made her patient eat and drink, she essayed once
again to enlist the woman's will in her own behalf.</p>

<p>"It's no use of me trying, Miss Constance; I've
got to go back when I'm fit. There ain't nothing
else for the likes of me to do."</p>

<p>"How can you tell till you try? O Margaret, I
wish you would try!"</p>

<p>A smile of hard-earned wisdom flitted across the
face of the woman. "You know more than most
of 'em," she said, "but you don't know it all. You
can't, you see; you're so good the world puts on its
gloves before it touches you. But for the likes of
me, we get the bare hand, and we're playing in luck
if it ain't made into a fist."</p>

<p>"You poor girl! It makes my heart ache to
think what you must have gone through before you
could learn to say a thing like that. But you must
try; I can't let you go back to that awful place after
what you've told me about it."</p>

<p>"Supposing I did try; there's only the one thing
on earth I know how to do,&mdash;that's trim hats.
Suppose you run your pretty feet off till you found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
me a place where I could work right. How long
would it be before somebody would go to the missis,
or the boss, or whoever it might be, and say, 'See
here; you've got one of Pete Grim's Bijou women
in there. That won't do.' And the night after,
I'd be doing my specialty again, if I was that lucky
to get on."</p>

<p>"But you could learn to do housework, or something
of that kind, so you could keep out of the way
of people who would remember you. You must
have had some experience."</p>

<p>The invalid rocked her head on the pillow.
"That'd be worse than the other. Somebody'd be
dead sure to find out and tell; and then I'd be
lucky if I got off without going to jail. And for
the experience,&mdash;a minute ago you called me a girl,
but I know you didn't mean it. How old do you
think I am?"</p>

<p>Constance looked at the fever-burned face, and
tried to make allowances for the ravages of disease.
"I should say twenty-five," she replied, "only you
talk as if you might be older."</p>

<p>"I'll be eighteen next June, if I'd happen to live
that long," said Margaret; and Constance went
home a few minutes later with a new pain in her
heart, born of the simple statement.</p>

<p>At the gate she took the empty basket and paid
the boy. "That's all for to-day, but I want to give
you some more work," she said. "Every morning,
and every noon, and every night, until I tell you to
stop, I want you to go up to that last place and ask<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Margaret Gannon if there is anything you can do
for her. And if she says yes, you do it; and if it's
too big for you to do, you come right up here after
me. Will you do all that?"</p>

<p>"Will I? Will a yaller dorg eat his supper w'en
he's hungry? You're jes' dead right I'll do it.
An' I'll be yere to-morrer afternoon, promp'."</p>

<p>All of which was well enough in its way, but the
problem was yet unsolved, and Constance had to
draw heavily on her reserves of cheerfulness to be
able to make an accordant one of four when Richard
Bartrow called that evening after dinner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the week following the day of repentance
and backsliding, Jeffard's regression down the inclined
plane became an accelerated rush. In that
interval he parted with his watch and his surveying
instruments, and made a beginning on his surplus
clothing. It was a measure of the velocity of the
descent that the watch, with the transit and level,
brought him no more than seven knife-and-fork
meals and an occasional luncheon. But the clothing
being transmutable in smaller installments, did
rather better.</p>

<p>Before the week was out, a bachelor's apartment
in a respectable locality became an incongruous
superfluity; and having by no means reached the
philosophical level in his descent, he hid himself
from all comers in a dubious neighborhood below
Larimer Street.</p>

<p>The second week brought sharper misery than the
first, since it enforced the pitiful shifts of vagrancy
before he could acquire the spirit-breaking experience
which makes them tolerable. But before many
days the poor remnants of pride and self-respect
gave up the unequal struggle, leaving him to his
own devices; after which he soon learned how to
keep an open and unbalanced meal-and-cigar account
with his few unmercenary friends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>In a short time, however, the friendly tables began
to grow scarce. Bartrow went back to his mine,
and with his going the doors of the St. James's dining-room
opened no more to the proletary. Then
came the return of John Pettigrew, whose hospitality
was as boundless as the range whereon his herds
grazed, and who claimed kinship with Jeffard because
both chanced to be transplanted New Englanders.
While Pettigrew stayed in Denver, Jeffard
lived on the fat of the land, eating at his friend's
table at the Albany, and gambling with the ranchman's
money at odd hours of the day and night.
But after Pettigrew left there was another lean interval,
and Jeffard grew haggard and ran his weight
down at the rate of a pound a day.</p>

<p>In the midst of this came a spasm of the reformative
sort, born of a passing glimpse of Stephen
Elliott's daughter on one of her charitable expeditions.
The incident brought him face to face with a
fact which had been unconsciously lending desperation
to despair. Now that the discovery could be
no more than an added twist of the thumbscrew, he
began to realize that he had found in the person of
the sweet-faced young woman with the far-seeing
eyes the Heaven-born alchemist who could, if she so
willed, transmute the flinty perverseness of him into
plastic wax, shaping it after her own ideals; that it
was the unacknowledged beginning of love which had
found wings for the short-lived flight of higher hopes
and more worthy aspirations. The day of fasting
and penitence had set his feet in the way leading to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
reinstatement in his own good opinion; but the meeting
with Constance was answerable for a worthier
prompting,&mdash;a perfervid determination to fight his
way back to better things for righteousness' sake,
knowing that no otherwise could he hope to stand
with her on the Mount of Benediction.</p>

<p>It was against this anointing of grace that he had
sinned; and it was in remorseful memory of it that
he brushed his clothes, put on an ill-fitting air of
respectability, and tramped the streets in a fruitless
search for employment until he was ready to
drop from fatigue and hunger. Nothing came of it.
The great public, and notably the employing minority
of it, is no mean physiognomist; and the gambler
carries his hall-mark no less than the profligate
or the drunkard.</p>

<p>At the close of one of these days of disheartenment,
a day wherein a single cup of coffee had been
made to stand sponsor for breakfast, luncheon, and
dinner, Jeffard saw a familiar figure standing at the
counter in one of the newspaper offices. Knowing
his man, Jeffard stopped on the sidewalk and waited.
If Lansdale had but the price of a single meal in
his pocket, two men would share that meal that
night.</p>

<p>There were two entrances to the newspaper office,
and Jeffard watched beaglewise lest his chance of
breaking his fast should vanish while he tarried.
Presently Lansdale came out, and Jeffard fell upon
him before he could latch the door.</p>

<p>"Salaam! Jeffard, my son," said the outcomer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
"I saw you waiting for me. How goes the world-old
struggle for existence?"</p>

<p>"Don't remind me of it, Lansdale; do you happen
to have the price of a meal about you?"</p>

<p>Lansdale smiled, and gravely tucking Jeffard's
arm under his own, steered diagonally across the
street toward the open doors of a café.</p>

<p>"Now that is what our forefathers called Providence,
and what we, being so much wiser in our own
generation, call luck," he declared. "I had just got
a check out of the post-office for a bit of work sent
months ago to an editor whose name is unhasting.
When you saw me I was closing a negotiation, by
the terms of which the cashier of the 'Coloradoan'
becomes my banker. Behold, now, the mysteries of&mdash;shall
we say Providence? At any time within
the six months I would have sworn that the opportune
moment for the arrival of this bit of money-paper
had come; nevertheless Providence, and the
slow-geared editor, get it here just in time to save
two men from going to bed supperless. Why don't
you say something?"</p>

<p>They were at the door of the café, and Jeffard
gripped his companion's arm and thrust him in.
"Can't you see that I'm too damned hungry to
talk?" he demanded savagely; and Lansdale wisely
held his peace until the barbarian in his guest had
been appeased.</p>

<p>When the soup and fish had disappeared, Jeffard
was ashamed of himself, and said as much.</p>

<p>"You mustn't mind what I said," he began, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
way of making amends. "I used to think I was a
civilized being, but, God help me, Lansdale, I'm
not! When I've gone without food for twenty-four
hours on end, I'm nothing more or less than a hungry
savage."</p>

<p>Lansdale smiled intelligence. "I know the taste
of it, and it's bad medicine&mdash;for the soul as well
as for the body," he rejoined. "There is reason to
suspect that Shakespeare never went hungry, else
he wouldn't have said, 'Sweet are the uses of adversity.'
They're not sweet; they're damnably bitter.
A man may come forth of the winepress with bones
unbroken and insight sharpened to the puncturing
point; but his capacity for evil will be increased in
just proportion."</p>

<p>"I don't want to believe that," said Jeffard, whose
despair was not yet proof against a good meal in
good company.</p>

<p>"You needn't, but it's true. The necessities
breed a certain familiarity with evil. Moral metes
and bounds have a trick of disappearing in the day
of physical dearth. When hunger has driven a man
over the ethical boundary a few times, the crossing
becomes easy; and when hunger drops the whip, inclination
is very likely to take it up."</p>

<p>Jeffard laughed. "'The words of Agur the son
of Jakeh,'" he quoted. "I believe you'd moralize
if you were going to be hanged, Lansdale."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I should. What possible contingency
could offer better opportunities? And am I not
going to be hanged&mdash;or choked, which amounts to
the same thing?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Jeffard looked up quickly and saw what the myopia
of hunger had hitherto obscured: that his companion's
smooth-shaven face seemed gaunter than
usual, and that his hands were unsteady when he
lifted the knife and fork.</p>

<p>"Colorado isn't helping you, then," he said.</p>

<p>"No; but it isn't altogether Colorado's fault.
The Boston medicine man said change of climate,
plenty of outdoor indolence, nutritious food at stated
intervals. I have all any one could ask of the first,
and as little of either of the others as may be."</p>

<p>"But you do good work, Lansdale. I've always
believed you could make it win, in time. Hasn't
the time come yet?"</p>

<p>"No. What I can do easiest would bring bread
and meat, if I could sell it; but a literary hack-writer
has no business in Colorado&mdash;or anywhere
else outside of the literary centres. In Boston I
could always find an odd job of reviewing, or space-writing,
or something that would serve to keep body
and soul together; but here they won't have me
even in the newspapers."</p>

<p>"Overcrowded, I suppose, like everything else
in this cursed country."</p>

<p>"That's the alleged reason; but the fact is that
I'm not a journalist. Your thoroughbred newspaper
man has more or less contempt for a fellow
who can't or won't write journalese."</p>

<p>They had attained to the dessert, and the waiter
was opening a modest bottle of claret for them.
Jeffard turned his wineglass down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>"What! Is that the way you flout a man's hospitality?"
demanded Lansdale, in mock displeasure.</p>

<p>"No; I don't mean to do that. But I'm drunken
with feasting now, and if I put wine into me I shall
pawn the coat off my back before midnight for a
stake to play with."</p>

<p>Lansdale smiled. "I'll see that you don't have
to. Turn up your glass."</p>

<p>But Jeffard was obstinate, and sat munching
raisins while Lansdale sipped his wine. When the
waiter brought the cigars he came out of his reverie
to say, "You want to live, don't you, Lansdale?"</p>

<p>The potential man of letters took time to think
about it. "I suppose I do; else I shouldn't be
starving to death in Denver," he admitted finally.</p>

<p>"And there is nothing but the lack of a little ready
money that keeps you from giving the Boston doctor's
prescription a fair trial. If I had the money
I believe I'd change places with you; that is, I'd
give you the money in exchange for your good
chance of being able to shuffle off mortality without
the help of extraneous means. I think I've had
enough of it."</p>

<p>"Do you? That proves how little a man has
learned when he thinks he has arrived. Now pull
yourself together, and tell me what you really would
do if you became suddenly rich."</p>

<p>"How rich?"</p>

<p>"Oh, make it a comfortable figure; say eight or
ten thousand a month for an income."</p>

<p>"I'd do what I said I should,&mdash;change places<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
with you; only I suppose that wouldn't be possible.
Failing that"&mdash;He pondered over it for a moment,
balancing his fork on the edge of his plate the
while. "A few weeks ago I should have mapped
out a future worth talking about. I had a lucid
day, in which the things that make for ambition of
the better sort had their inning. If you had asked
me such a question then, I should doubtless have
told you that I should try to realize the ideals of
other days; to walk uprightly, and to hold great
wealth as it should be held&mdash;in trust for the good
of one's kind; to win the love of the ideal woman,
perhaps; and, having won it, to sit at her feet until
I had learned how to be God's almoner."</p>

<p>Lansdale's smile was not wholly cynical. "But
now?" he queried.</p>

<p>"But now I know my own limitations. I think
I should go back to the old farm in the Berkshire
Hills, and try to make it earn me bread and meat."</p>

<p>"But you couldn't spend ten thousand a month
on an abandoned farm, though I grant you it would
be a pretty expensive luxury. What would you do
with the lave of it?"</p>

<p>Jeffard's lips tightened, and his face was not pleasant
to look upon. "I'd let it go on accumulating,
piling up and up till there was no shadow of possibility
that I should ever again come to know what
it means to be without money. And even then I
should know I could never get enough," he added.</p>

<p>This time Lansdale's smile was of incredulity.
"Let me prophesy," he suggested. "When your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
lucky day overtakes you, you will do none of these
things. Jeffard the fool may be heard of wherever
the Associated Press has a wire or a correspondent;
but Jeffard the miser will never exist outside of your
own unbalanced imagination. Let's go out and walk.
It's fervidly close in here."</p>

<p>Arm in arm they paced the streets until nearly
midnight, talking of things practical and impracticable,
and keeping well out of the present in either
the past or the future. When Lansdale said good-night,
he stuffed a bank-note into Jeffard's pocket.</p>

<p>"It's only a loan," he protested, when Jeffard
would have made him take it back. "And there
are no conditions. You can go and play with it, if
that's what you'd rather do."</p>

<p>The suggestion was unfortunate, though possibly
the result would have been the same in any event.
Five minutes after parting from Lansdale, Jeffard
had taken his place in the silent group around the
table in the upper room; and by the time the pile
of counters under his hand had increased to double
the amount of Lansdale's gift, he was oblivious to
everything save the one potent fact&mdash;that after so
many reverses his luck had turned at last.</p>

<p>Five hundred and odd dollars he had at one time
in that eventful sitting, and his neighbor across the
corner of the table, a grizzled miner with the jaw of
a pugilist and eyes that had a trick of softening
like a woman's, had warned him by winks, nods,
and sundry kicks under the table to stop. Jeffard
scowled his resentment of the interference and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
played on, losing steadily until his capital had shrunk
to fifty dollars. Then the miner rose up in his
place, reached across, and gave Jeffard an open-handed
buffet that nearly knocked him out of his
chair.</p>

<p>"Dad blame you!" he roared; "I'll learn you
how to spile my play! Stan' up and fight it out
like a man!"</p>

<p>The game stopped at once. The dealer held his
hand, and the banker reached for his revolver.</p>

<p>"You two gen'lemen cash in and get out o' here,"
he commanded. "This is a gen'leman's game, and
we don't run no shootin'-gallery&mdash;leastwise, not unless
<i>I</i> have to take a hand in it. Pass in your
chips."</p>

<p>They both obeyed; the miner with maledictory
reluctance, and Jeffard in a tremulous frenzy of
wrath. When they reached the sidewalk, Jeffard
flung himself savagely upon his assailant, only to
learn that abstinence is a poor trainer, and that he
was little better than a lay-figure in the grasp of the
square-jawed one with the melting eyes. The big
man thrust him into a corner and held him there
until he listened to reason.</p>

<p>"You blamed idjit! you hain't got sense enough
to go in when it rains! Hold still, 'r I'll bump your
head ag'inst the wall! As I was sayin', you don't
know enough to pound sand. Every single time
I've been in this dive, you've been here, too,
a-blowin' yourself like you had a wad as big as a
feather bed, and you know danged well you hain't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
got nothin'. And you wouldn't 'a' kep' a dern cent
to-night, if I hadn't thumped you and raised a row.
Now you go and hunt you a place to sleep while
you've got dust enough to pay for it; and don't you
come round here ag'in till you've put a whole grub-stake
inside of you. Savez?"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">From</span> the beginning of the cannibalistic stage of
the journey down the inclined plane, Jeffard had determined
that, come what might, he would keep
enough of his wardrobe to enable him to present an
outward appearance of respectability. With a vague
premonition of the not improbable end of the journey
he recoiled at the thought of figuring before a
coroner's jury as a common vagrant.</p>

<p>This resolution, however, like all others of a prideful
nature, went down before the renewed assaults
of the allies, hunger and dementia. Whereby it
speedily came to pass that he retained only the garments
he stood in, and these soon became shabby
and wayworn. Since, in his own estimation, if not
in that of others, the clothes do make the man to a
very considerable extent, Jeffard gradually withdrew
from his former lounging-places, confining himself
to the less critical region below Larimer Street
during the day, and avoiding as much as possible
the haunts of his former associates at all hours.</p>

<p>It was for this cause that Bartrow, on his return
from Chaffee County, was unable to find Jeffard.
Meeting Lansdale when the search had become
unhopeful, the large-hearted man of the altitudes
lamented his failure after his own peculiar fashion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>"When was it you saw him last?" he inquired
of the transplanted Bostonian.</p>

<p>"It was about a week ago. To be exact, it was a
week Tuesday. I remember because we dined together
that evening."</p>

<p>"Now doesn't that beat the band? Here I've
gone and got him a soft snap up on the range&mdash;good
pay, and little or nothing to do&mdash;and he's got
to go and drop out like a monte man's little joker.
It's enough to make a man swear continuous!"</p>

<p>"I don't think he would have gone with you,"
Lansdale ventured.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't, eh? If I can find him I'll take
him by the neck and make him go; savez? How
do you put it up? Runaway? or a pile of bones out
on the prairie somewhere?"</p>

<p>"It's hard to say. Jeffard's a queer combination
of good and not so good,&mdash;like a few others of
us,&mdash;and just now the negative part is on top. He
was pretty low the night we were together, though
when we separated I thought he was taking himself
a little less seriously."</p>

<p>"Didn't talk about getting the drop on himself,
or anything like that?"</p>

<p>"N&mdash;no, not in a way to leave the impression
that he was in any immediate danger of doing such
a thing."</p>

<p>Bartrow chewed the end of his cigar reflectively.
"Hasn't taken to quizzing the world through the
bottom of a whiskey-glass?"</p>

<p>"No, I should say not. Thus far, I think he has
but the one devil."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"And that's the 'tiger,' of course. I knew about
that; I've known it all along. The Lord forgive
me! I don't know but I was the ring-master in that
show. You know we chased around a good deal
together, along at the first, and it's as likely as not
I showed him a whole lot of things he'd better not
have seen."</p>

<p>The half-cynical smile lightened upon Lansdale's
grave face. "That is one of my criticisms of
Western manners," he commented. "When you
get hold of a stranger, you welcome him with open
arms&mdash;and proceed to regale him with a near-hand
view of the back yards and cesspools. And then you
swear piteously when he goes back East and tells
his friends what an abandoned lot you are."</p>

<p>Bartrow took the thrust good-naturedly, as he did
most of his chastenings. "That's right; that's
just about what we do. But you've been here long
enough now to know that it's meant for hospitality.
It's a way we've got into of taking it for granted
that people come out here more to see the sights
than for any other purpose."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's good of you&mdash;I don't deny that; only
it's a little rough on the new-comer, sometimes.
Take Jeffard's case, for example. He came to
Denver with good introductions; I know, for I
saw some of them. But a man in a strange city
doesn't often go about presenting his social credentials.
What he does is to make a few haphazard
acquaintances, and let them set the pace for him.
That is what Jeffard did, and I'll venture to say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
there have been nine evil doors open to him to one
good one. You've known him longer than any one
else&mdash;how many times have you invited him to
spend a rational evening with you in the company
of respectable people?"</p>

<p>"Good Lord, Lansdale; for Heaven's sake don't
begin to open up that lead! We're all miserable
sinners, and I'm the medicine-man of the tribe. I
never asked the poor devil to go visiting with me
but once, and that was after he was down."</p>

<p>"And then he wouldn't go, as a matter of course.
But that is neither here nor there. I'll find him
for you, if I can, and leave word for you at the St.
James."</p>

<p>"You're a brick, Lansdale; that's about what
you are. I'll get square with you some day. By
the way, can't you come up to Steve Elliott's with
me this evening and meet some good people?"</p>

<p>Lansdale laughed outright. "You're a good
fellow, Bartrow, but you're no diplomat. When I
go a-fishing into your mentality you'll never see the
hook. Make my apologies to your friends, and tell
them I'm an invalid."</p>

<p>And Bartrow, being densely practical, and so
proof against irony of whatsoever calibre, actually
did so that evening when he called upon Miss
Elliott and her cousin.</p>

<p>"But your friend wasn't promised to us, Mr. Bartrow,"
objected Miss Van Vetter. "Why should he
send excuses?"</p>

<p>"I'm blessed if I know," said honest Dick, looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
innocently from one to the other of them. "But
that's what he told me to do, and I've done it."</p>

<p>Constance laughed softly. "You're too good for
any use, Dick. He was making game of you. Tell
us how he came to say it."</p>

<p>Bartrow did that, also; and the two young women
laughed in chorus.</p>

<p>"After you've had your fun out of it I wish
you'd tell me, so I can laugh too," he said. "I
can't see where the joke comes in, myself."</p>

<p>Constance enlightened him. "There isn't any
joke&mdash;only this: he had just been scolding you
about your inhospitality, and then you turn on him
and ask him to go calling with you. Of course,
he couldn't accept, then; it would have been like
inviting himself."</p>

<p>"Well, what of it? I don't see why he shouldn't
invite himself, if he felt like it. He's a rattling
good fellow." And from thence the talk drifted
easily to Jeffard, who was, or who had been, another
good fellow.</p>

<p>At the mention of Jeffard's name, Constance
borrowed the mask of disinterest, and laid her commands
on Bartrow. "Tell us about him," she said.</p>

<p>"There isn't much to tell. He came here from
somewhere back East, got into bad company, lost
his money, and now he's disappeared."</p>

<p>"How did he lose his money?" Constance would
have asked the question, but her cousin forestalled
her.</p>

<p>"Gambled it," quoth Bartrow placidly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>Constance looked sorry, and Miss Van Vetter
was plainly shocked. "How very dreadful!" said
the latter. "Did he lose much?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no; you couldn't call it much&mdash;only a
few thousands, I believe. But then, you see, it was
his stake; it was all he had, and he couldn't afford
to give it up. And now he has gone and hid out
somewhere just when I have found a place for him.
It makes me very weary."</p>

<p>"Can't you find any trace of him?" queried
Constance. "That is singular. I should think he
would have left his address."</p>

<p>Bartrow grinned. "Well, hardly. Man don't
leave his address when he wants to drop out.
That's the one thing he's pretty sure to take with
him. But we'll run him down yet, if he's on top
of earth. Lansdale has seen more of him lately
than I have, and he is taking a hand. He and
Jeffard used to flock together a good deal when the
shoe was on the other foot."</p>

<p>Miss Van Vetter looked mystified; and Bartrow
deemed it a matter for self-congratulation that he
was able to comprehend the query in her eyes without
having it hurled at him in so many words.</p>

<p>"That was while Jeffard had money, and Lansdale
was trying to starve himself to death," he explained.
"You see, Lansdale is a queer fish in
some ways. When he's down he won't let anybody
touch him on his money side, so we used to work all
kinds of schemes to keep him going. Jeffard would
study them up, and I'd help him steer them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>This was practical benevolence, and Connie's interest
bestirred itself in its charitable part. "What
were some of the schemes?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, there were a lot of them. Lansdale can
see farther into a millstone than most people, and
we had to invent new ones as we went along. One
time, Jeffard bought a common, every-day sort of a
pocketbook, and rumpled it up and tramped on it
till it looked as if it might have come across the
plains in Fifty-nine. Then he put a twenty-dollar
bill and some loose silver in it, and dropped it on
the sidewalk where I was walking Lansdale up and
down for his health. After a while, when he'd
actually stumbled over it four or five times, Lansdale
saw the wallet and picked it up. Right there
the scheme nearly fell down. You see, he was
going to make me take charge of it while he advertised
it. I got out of it, somehow, but I don't
believe he used a nickel of the money for a month."</p>

<p>Connie clapped her hands softly. "That was
fine! Tell us some more."</p>

<p>"The next one was better, and it worked like a
charm. Lansdale writes things for the papers, only
the editors here wouldn't buy any of his work"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why not?" interrupted Miss Van Vetter.</p>

<p>"I don't know; because it was too good, I guess.
Anyway, they wouldn't buy it, so Jeffard went to
work on that lead. I took him around and introduced
him to Kershaw of the 'Coloradoan,' and he
made Kershaw take fifty dollars on deposit, and got
him to promise to accept some of Lansdale's stories.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Kershaw kicked like the deu&mdash;like the mischief,
and didn't want to do it; but we bullied him, and
then I got Lansdale to send him some stuff."</p>

<p>"Mr. Jeffard is an artist in schemes, and I envy
him," said Connie. "What happened to that one?"</p>

<p>"Kershaw upset it by not printing the stuff. Of
course, Lansdale watched the 'Coloradoan,' and
when he found he wasn't in it, he wouldn't send
any more. We caught him the next time, though,
for something worth while."</p>

<p>"How was that?" It was Miss Van Vetter who
asked the question; and Bartrow made a strenuous
effort to evade the frontier idiom which stood ready
to trip him at every turn when Myra Van Vetter's
poiseful gaze rested upon him.</p>

<p>"Why, I happen to have a played-out&mdash;er&mdash;that
is, a sort of no-account mine up in Clear Creek,
and I made Lansdale believe I was the resident
agent for the property, authorized to get up a descriptive
prospectus. He took the job of writing it,
and never once tumbled to the racket&mdash;that is, he
never suspected that we were working him for a&mdash;oh,
good Lord, why can't I talk plain English!&mdash;you
know what I mean; he thought it was all
straight. Well, he turned in the copy, and we paid
him as much as he'd stand; but he has just about
worried the life out of me ever since, trying to get
to read proof on that prospectus. That one was
Jeffard's idea, too, but I made him let me in on the
assessment."</p>

<p>Before Miss Van Vetter could inquire what the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
"assessment" was, Stephen Elliott came in and
the talk became general. An hour later, when Bartrow
took his leave, Constance went to the door
with him.</p>

<p>"Don't you really know where Mr. Jeffard is,
Dick?" she asked.</p>

<p>Something in her tone set him upon the right
track. "No; do you?"</p>

<p>"I know that he left Denver quite a while ago;
about the time you were down last."</p>

<p>"How do you know it?"</p>

<p>"He told me he was going."</p>

<p>"The mischief he did! Where did you get
acquainted with him?"</p>

<p>"At Mrs. Calmaine's."</p>

<p>Honest Dick ground his heel into the door-mat
and thrust his hands deep into the pockets of his
overcoat. What was in his mind came out shorn
of euphemism.</p>

<p>"Say, Connie, do you care anything about him?"</p>

<p>"What a question!" she retorted, not pretending
to misunderstand its pointing. "I've met him
only once&mdash;or twice, I should say, though I didn't
even know his name the first time."</p>

<p>"What did he tell you? about his going away, I
mean."</p>

<p>"He said&mdash;but you've no right to ask me,
Dick. It wasn't exactly a confidence, but"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, I have a right to ask; he was my friend a
good while before he was yours. Tell me what he
said."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"He gave me to understand that things hadn't
been going quite right with him, and he said he was
going to the mountains to&mdash;to try to make another
start."</p>

<p>Bartrow tucked Connie's arm under his own and
walked her up and down the long veranda twice before
he could bring himself to say the thing that
was.</p>

<p>"He didn't go, Connie; he's here now, if he
hasn't gone out on the prairie somewhere and taken
a pot shot at himself. Lansdale saw him only a
week or so ago."</p>

<p>"Oh, Dick!"</p>

<p>"It's tough, isn't it?" He stood on the step
and buttoned his coat. "But I'm glad you know
him&mdash;or at least, know who he is. If you should
happen to run across him in any of your charity
trips, just set Tommie on him and wire me if you
find out where he burrows."</p>

<p>"You said you had found a place for him. Will
it keep?"</p>

<p>"I'll try to hold it open for him, and if you wire,
I'll come down and tackle him. He's too good a
fellow to turn down in his little day of witlessness.
Good-night; and good-by&mdash;for a week or
so. I've got to go back on the morning train."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Contrary</span> to the doctor's prophecy, Margaret
Gannon's progress toward recovery was slow and
rather uncertain. Constance professed to be sorry,
but in her heart she was thankful, since the hesitant
convalescence gave her time to try many expedients
pointing toward the moral rehabilitation of her protégée.
Ignoring Margaret's bodeful prediction, Constance
coursed far and wide, quartering the domestic
field diligently; but inasmuch as she was careful in
each instance to state the exact truth, each endeavor
was but the introduction to another failure.</p>

<p>"Why, Constance Elliott! The idea of your proposing
such a thing to me!" said Mrs. Calmaine,
upon whose motherly good sense Connie had leaned
from childhood. "That is what comes of a girl
growing up as you have without a mother to watch
over her. Can't you understand how dreadful it is
for you to mix up in such things? You can't touch
pitch and not be defiled."</p>

<p>Connie was moved, first to tears, and presently to
indignation.</p>

<p>"No, I can't understand anything of the kind,"
she retorted. "It's your privilege not to take
Margaret if you don't want her; but it's mine to
help her, if I can. And I mean to do it in spite of
all the cruel prejudice in the world!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"You talk like a foolish child, Connie. I can
tell you beforehand that you won't succeed in getting
the woman into any respectable household in
Denver, unless you do it under false pretenses."</p>

<p>"So much the worse for our Christianity, then,"
Connie asserted stoutly. "If people won't help,
they'll have it to answer to One who wasn't afraid
to take a much worse woman by the hand. That's
all I have to say about it."</p>

<p>Mrs. Calmaine smiled benignantly. She had
daughters of her own, and knew how to make allowances
for youthful enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"You will get over it, after a while, and then
you'll see how foolish it is to try to reform the
world single-handed," she rejoined. "You might as
well try to move Pike's Peak as to think you can
remodel society after your own enthusiastic notions.
And when the reflective after-time comes, you'll be
glad that society didn't let you make a martyr of
yourself at its expense.</p>

<p>"And, Connie, dear; there is another side of the
question which you should consider," she continued,
going to the door with her visitor. "It's this:
since society as a unit insists upon having this particular
kind of reformative work turned over to organizations
designed for the purpose, there must be
a sufficient reason for it. You are not wiser than
the aggregated wisdom of the civilized centuries."</p>

<p>Constance went her way, silenced, but by no
means convinced; and she added three more failures
to her long list before going home to luncheon. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the afternoon, she laid hold of her courage yet once
again, and went to her minister, good Dr. Launceston,
pastor of St. Cyril's-in-the-Desert. Here, indeed,
she found sympathy without stint, but it was
hopelessly void of practical suggestion.</p>

<p>"It is certainly most pitiful, Miss Elliott, pitiful
to a degree; but I really don't see what is to be
done. Had you any plan in view that, ah"&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is because all my plans have come to grief
that I am here," said Connie.</p>

<p>"Dear, dear! and those cases are so very hard to
deal with. Now, if it were a question of money, I
dare say we could manage it quite easily."</p>

<p>Constance had some very clear ideas on reformative
subjects, and one of them was that it was not less
culpable to pauperize than to ignore.</p>

<p>"It isn't that," she made haste to say. "I could
get money easily enough, but Margaret wouldn't take
it. If she would, I should have small hopes for her."</p>

<p>"No," rejoined the clergyman reflectively; "you
are quite right. It is not a problem to be solved by
money. The young woman must be given a chance
to win her way back to respectability by her own
efforts. Do I understand that she is willing to try
if the opportunity should present itself?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I can't say that she is&mdash;not without
reservation," Connie admitted. "You see, she
knows the cruel side of the world; and she is quite
sure that any effort she might make would end in
defeat and deeper disgrace."</p>

<p>"A very natural apprehension, and one for which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
there are only too good grounds," said the clergyman
sadly. "We are compassionate and charitable in
the aggregate, but as individuals I fear we are very
unmerciful. Had you thought of trying to send
her to one of our institutional homes in the East? I
might possibly be able to make such representations
as would"&mdash;</p>

<p>Constance shook her head. "Margaret is a Roman
Catholic, and I suggested the House of the Good
Shepherd in one of our earlier talks. She fought
the idea desperately, and I don't know that I blame
her. She is just a woman like other women, and
I believe she would gladly undertake an honest
woman's work in the world; but that isn't saying
she'd be willing to become a lay-sister."</p>

<p>"No, I suppose not; I quite agree with you.
But what else can you do for her?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, Doctor Launceston,&mdash;oh, I don't
know! But I'll never give up till I've done something."</p>

<p>In the momentary afflatus of which fine determination
Constance went her way again, not wholly
comfortless this time, but apparently quite as far
from the solution of the problem as when she had
latched Mrs. Calmaine's gate behind her.</p>

<p>As for the clergyman, the precious fervor of the
young enthusiast left a spark in his heart which
burst into flame on the following Sunday morning,
when he preached a stirring sermon from the text,
"Who is my neighbor?" to the decorous and well-fed
congregation of St. Cyril's-in-the-Desert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>Leaving the rectory, Constance postponed the
quest for that afternoon and went to pay her daily
visit to Margaret. On the way downtown a happy
thought came to her, and she welcomed it as an
inspiration, setting it to work as soon as she had put
the convalescent's room in order.</p>

<p>"You are feeling better to-day, aren't you,
Margaret?" she began.</p>

<p>"Yes. I'm thinking I'll be able to go to work
again before long; only Pete Grim mightn't have
no use for me."</p>

<p>Constance brought the hair-brush, and letting
Margaret's luxuriant hair fall in heavy masses over
the back of the chair, began another of her ministries
of service.</p>

<p>"Do you really want to go back to the Bijou?"
she asked, knowing well enough what the answer
would be.</p>

<p>"You know you needn't to ask that; it's just
Pete Grim's place or something worse. I can't do
no different"&mdash;she paused and the fingers of her
clasped hands worked nervously&mdash;"and you can't
help it, Miss Constance. I know you've been trying
and worrying; but it ain't no use."</p>

<p>Connie did not find words to reply at once, but
after a little she said: "Tell me more about your
old home, Margaret."</p>

<p>"I've told you all there was to tell, many's the
time since you found me with the fever."</p>

<p>"Let me see if I can remember it. You said
your father was the village blacksmith, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
you used to sit in the shop and watch the sparks fly
from the anvil as he worked. And when his day's
work was done, he would take you on his shoulder
and carry you home to your mother, who called you
her pretty colleen, and loved you because you were
the only girl. And then"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>don't</i>!" There was sharp anguish in the
cry, and Margaret covered her eyes with her hands
as if to shut out the picture. Constance waited
until she thought she had given the seed time to
germinate. Then she went on.</p>

<p>"And when you left home they mourned for you,
not as one dead, but as one living and still beloved;
and as long as they could keep track of you they
begged you to come back to them. Margaret, won't
you go?"</p>

<p>Margaret shook her head in passionate negation.
"I can't&mdash;<i>I can't!</i> that's the one thing I can't do!
Didn't I bring them shame enough and misery
enough in the one day? and will I be going back to
stir it all up again? having the people say, 'There's
Pat Gannon's girl come back; she that went to the
bad and broke her mother's heart.' Indeed, I'll
not do that, Miss Constance, though the saints and
the holy angels'll tell you I'd do anything else you'd
ask."</p>

<p>This was Connie's happy thought; to induce
Margaret to go back to her parents. When it
proved to be but another rope of sand, she allowed
it one sigh and changed front so cheerfully that
Margaret never knew the cost of the effort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then we must try something else," she insisted.
"I'll never let you go back to the theatre&mdash;that's
settled. You told me once you could trim hats.
Have you ever done any other kind of sewing?"</p>

<p>Margaret knelt before her trunk and threw out
an armful of her stage finery. "I made them," she
said.</p>

<p>Constance examined the work critically. It was
good, and she took courage. "That is our way out
of the trouble, Margaret. Why didn't we think of
it before? When you are well enough, I'll get you
a sewing-machine and find you all the work you can
do."</p>

<p>Margaret went to the window and stood there so
long that Constance began to tremble lest the battle
were going evilward at the last moment. The fear
was groundless, as she found out when the girl came
back to kneel and cry silently with her face in Connie's
lap.</p>

<p>"It isn't so much the love of you," she sobbed;
"it's the knowing that somebody cares whether the
likes of me goes straight to the devil or not. And
never so much as a word about behaving myself, or
confessing to the priest, or anything. Miss Constance,"&mdash;this
with uplifted face, grown suddenly
beautiful and glorified in the outshining of penitence,&mdash;"the
devil may fly away with me,&mdash;he did
that same one day,&mdash;but if he does, I'll not live
to leave him have the good of it. I promise you
that."</p>

<p>"I can trust you," said Constance; and she took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
her leave presently, wondering how the many-sided
world could so unify itself in its merciless condemnation
of the Magdalenes.</p>

<p>When she had closed Margaret's door behind her
and was halfway to the stair, she heard sounds as
of a scuffle coming from a corridor intersecting the
main hallway at the landing. Her first impulse was
to retreat to Margaret Gannon's room; but when she
recognized Tommie's voice uplifted in alternate plea
and imprecation, she went forward quickly. At the
turn she met a gaunt, unshaven man leading Tommie
by the ear, and her indignation slipped the leash
without a thought of consequences.</p>

<p>"Aren't you ashamed of yourself to abuse a
child like that!" she began; and then two things
happened: Jeffard released the boy, and Constance
recognized in the gaunt figure the wreck of the man
whom she had bidden God-speed on the stair at the
Calmaine dancing party.</p>

<p>Jeffard flattened himself against the wall, bowed
low, and was about to apologize, when Tommie,
scenting an accusation, proceeded to vindicate himself
by exploding a veritable bomb of consternation
between the two.</p>

<p>"I warn't doin' ary single thing, Miss Constance,
'ceptin' jest wot you telled me to do. I caught on to
his nibs down on de street an' follered him up yere;
an' w'en I was takin' a squint t'rough de keyhole,
jest to make sure, he outs an' nabs me."</p>

<p>For one dreadful instant Connie thought she must
scream and run away. Then her wits came back,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
and she saw that deliverance could come only
through swift confession.</p>

<p>"Tommie," she said hastily, "run down and wait
for me on the sidewalk." And then to Jeffard:
"The poor boy wasn't to blame; he was doing just
what he had been told to do, and you have a right
to ask&mdash;to&mdash;to know"&mdash;She stopped in pitiable
embarrassment, and Jeffard flung himself into the
breach with chivalric tact.</p>

<p>"Not another word, Miss Elliott, I implore you.
It isn't the first time I have been taken for my
double, and in broad daylight at that. May I go
down and make my peace with the boy?"</p>

<p>Constance was too greatly perturbed not to catch
gratefully at the chance to escape, and she made use
of it while Jeffard was talking to Tommie at the
foot of the stair. Taking Constance's nod and smile
in passing as tokens of amity, the urchin allowed
himself to be placated; and when Jeffard went back
to his room he knew all that Tommie could tell him
about Miss Elliott and her deeds of mercy.</p>

<p>That night, before he went out to tramp himself
weary, Jeffard did a characteristic thing. He
wrapped his last five-dollar note around a bit of
plaster dug from the wall, and creeping through the
corridor in his stocking feet, tossed the pellet over
the transom into Margaret Gannon's room.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the breakfast-table the next morning, Constance
had a shock that set her nerves a-jangle and banished
her appetite. The exciting cause was a paragraph
in the morning "Coloradoan" which her father had
been reading between the fruit and the cereals.</p>

<p>"I wonder if that isn't the fellow Dick was looking
for and couldn't find," he queried, passing the
paper across the table with his finger on the suggestive
paragraph.</p>

<p>It was a custom-hardened account of a commonplace
tragedy. A man whose name was given as
George Jeffrey had shot himself an hour before
midnight on one of the bridges spanning Cherry
Creek. Constance read the story of the tragedy
with her father's remark in abeyance, and the shock
came with the conviction that the self-slain one was
Jeffard, whose name might easily become Jeffrey in
the hurried notes of a news-gatherer. The meagre
particulars tallied accurately with Bartrow's terse
account of Jeffard's sociological experiment. The
suicide was a late-comer from the farther East; he
had spent his money in riotous living; and he had
latterly been lost to those who knew him best.</p>

<p>It was characteristic of Stephen Elliott's daughter
that she passed the paper back to her father without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
comment, and that she preserved an outward presentment
of cheerfulness during the remainder of
the meal. But when she was free she ran up to her
room and was seen no more of her father or her
cousin until the latter went upstairs an hour later to
see if Connie were ready for her morning walk.</p>

<p>"Why, Connie, dear!  What is the matter?"</p>

<p>Since her tap at the door went unanswered, Myra
had turned the knob and entered. Connie was lying
in a dejected little heap on the floor before the fireless
grate. She shook her head in dumb protest at
her cousin's question; but when Myra knelt beside
her it all came out brokenly.</p>

<p>"You didn't see what poppa gave me to read: it
was an account of a suicide. Mr. Jeffard has killed
himself, and&mdash;and, oh, Myra! it's all my fault!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Jeffard? Oh, I remember now,&mdash;Mr.
Bartrow's friend. But I don't understand; how
could it have been your fault?"</p>

<p>"It was, it was! Don't you remember what Dick
said? that Mr. Jeffard was in trouble, and that he
had a place for him? I saw him yesterday, and I&mdash;<i>I
didn't tell him!</i>"</p>

<p>"But, Connie, dear, how could you? You didn't
know him." Getting no more than a smothered
sob in reply to this, Myra asked for particulars, and
Connie gave them sparingly.</p>

<p>"You say the name was George Jeffrey? Why
do you think it was Mr. Jeffard? I can't for the
life of me see how you are to blame, in the remotest
sense; but if you are, it's foolish to grieve over it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
until you are quite sure of the identities. Isn't
there any way you can find out?"</p>

<p>Connie sat up at that, but she refused to be
comforted.</p>

<p>"There is a way, and I'll try it; but it's no use,
Myra. I'm just as sure as if I had stood beside
him when he did it. And I shall never, <i>never</i> forgive
myself!"</p>

<p>She got up and bathed her eyes, and when she
had made herself ready to go out, she refused Myra's
proffer of company.</p>

<p>"No, dear; thank you, but I'd rather go alone,"
she objected; "I'll share the misery of it with you
by and by, perhaps, but I can't just yet."</p>

<p>Her plan for making sure was a simple one.
Tommie Reagan had known Jeffard living, and he
would know him dead. Putting it in train, she
found her small henchman selling papers on his
regular beat in front of the Opera House; and inasmuch
as he was crying the principal fact of the
tragedy, she was spared the necessity of entering
into details.</p>

<p>"Tommie, have you&mdash;did you go to see the man
who killed himself last night?" she questioned.</p>

<p>"Nope; der ain't no morbid cur'osity inside o'
me."</p>

<p>"Would you go?&mdash;if I asked you to?"</p>

<p>"W'y, cert; I'd take a squint at de old feller
wid de hoofs an' horns if it'd do you any good."</p>

<p>"Then I'll tell you why I want you to go. I am
afraid it is the man we were going to try to help."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>The boy shut one eye and whistled softly. "My
gosh! but dat's tough, ain't it now! An' jest w'en
I'd got 'quainted with him an' was a-fixin' to give
him a lift! Dat's wot I call hard luck!"</p>

<p>Constance felt that the uncertainty was no longer
to be borne. "Go quickly, Tommie," she directed;
"and hurry back as soon as you can. I'll wait for
you in the drug store across the street."</p>

<p>The coroner's office was not far to seek, and the
small scout was back in a few minutes.</p>

<p>"Dey wouldn't lemme look," he reported, "but I
skinned round to where I could see de top o' his
head. It's his nibs, right 'nough."</p>

<p>"Tommie! Are you quite sure?"</p>

<p>"Nope; feller ain't sure o' nothin' in dis world,
'ceptin' death an' de penitenchry," amended Tommie,
doing violence to his convictions when he saw that
his patron saint was sorely in need of comfort.
"Maybe 'tain't him, after all. You jest loaf 'round
yere a couple o' shakes while I skip down to his
hotel an' see wot I can dig up."</p>

<p>The boy was gone less than a quarter of an hour,
but to Constance the minutes marched leaden-footed.
When Tommie returned, his face signaled discomfiture.</p>

<p>"I didn't send me card up," he explained, with
impish gravity; "I jest went right up to his nibsey's
room an' mogged in, a-thinkin' I'd offer him a paper
if he happened to be there and kicked. Say, Miss
Constance; 'tain't a-goin' ter do no good to cry
about it. He ain't there, an' he ain't been there,
'nless he slep' in a chair."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Constance went home with a lump in her throat
and her trouble writ large on her face, and Myra
needed not to ask the result of the investigation.
Miss Van Vetter was not less curious than she
should have been, but something in Connie's eyes
forestalled inquiry, and Myra held her peace.</p>

<p>Connie wore out the day as best she might,
widening the rift of sorrow until it bade fair to
become an abyss of remorse. When evening came,
and with it a telegram from Bartrow, asking if she
had yet learned Jeffard's whereabouts, it was too
much, and she shared the misery with her cousin,
as she had promised to, making a clean breast of
it from the beginning. Something to her surprise,
Myra heard her through without a word of condemnation
or reproach.</p>

<p>"Now that is something I can understand," said
Myra, when the tale was told. "The most of your
charity work seems to me to be pitifully commonplace
and inconsequent; but here was a mission
which asked for all sorts of heroism, for which it
promised to pay the highest of all prices, namely,
the possibility of saving a man worth the trouble."</p>

<p>Now Connie was well assured that her love for
her neighbor was no respecter of persons, and she
made answer accordingly.</p>

<p>"I can't agree with you there, Myra. Mr. Jeffard's
possible worth had nothing to do with it. I
wanted to help him because&mdash;well, because it was
mean in me to make him talk about himself that
night at the opera. And besides, when I met him the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
next evening at Mrs. Calmaine's, he told me enough
to make me quite sure that he needed all the help
and encouragement he could get. Of course, he didn't
say anything like that, you know; but I knew."</p>

<p>Myra's eyes promised sympathy, and Connie went
on.</p>

<p>"Then, when I came upon him yesterday I was
angry because he was hurting Tommie. And afterward,
when I tried to explain, he made me understand
that I mustn't reach down to him; and&mdash;and
I didn't know any other way to go about it."</p>

<p>"That was a situation in which I should probably
have horrified you," said Myra decisively. "I
shouldn't have noticed or known anything about him
at first, as you did; but in your place yesterday, and
with your knowledge of the circumstances, I should
have said my say whether he wanted to hear it or
not. And I'd have made him listen to reason, too."</p>

<p>"You don't quite understand, Myra. It seemed
altogether impossible; though if I had known what
was in his mind I should have spoken at any cost."</p>

<p>Twenty times the pendulum of the chalet clock
on the wall beat the seconds, and Myra was silent;
then she crossed over to Connie's chair and sat upon
the arm of it.</p>

<p>"Connie, dear, you're crying again,"&mdash;this with
her arm around her cousin's neck. "Are you quite
sure you haven't been telling me half-truths?
Wasn't there the least little bit of a feeling warmer
than charity in your heart for this poor fellow?"</p>

<p>Constance shook her head, but the denial did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
set itself in words. "He was Dick's friend, and
that was enough," she replied.</p>

<p>Miss Van Vetter's lips brushed her cousin's cheek,
and Constance felt a warm tear plash on her hand.
This was quite another Myra from the one she
thought she knew, and she said as much.</p>

<p>"We're all puzzles, Connie dear, and the answers
to most of us have been lost; but, do you
know, I can't help crying a little with you for this
poor fellow. Just to think of him lying there with
no one within a thousand miles to care the least
little bit about it. And if you are right&mdash;if it is
Mr. Bartrow's friend&mdash;it's so much the more pitiful.
The world is poorer when such men leave it."</p>

<p>"Why, Myra! What do you know about him?"</p>

<p>"Nothing more than you do&mdash;or as much. But
surely you haven't forgotten what Mr. Bartrow told
us."</p>

<p>"About his helping Mr. Lansdale?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"No, I hadn't forgotten."</p>

<p>"It was very noble; and so delicately chivalrous.
It seems as if one who did such things would surely
be helped in his own day of misfortune. But that
doesn't often happen, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>"No," Constance assented, with a sigh; and Myra
went back to the question of identity.</p>

<p>"I suppose there is no possible chance that Tommie
may have been mistaken?"</p>

<p>Constance shook her head. "I think not; he
saw that I was troubled about it, and he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
have strained a point to comfort me if the facts had
given him leave. But I shall be quite sure before
I answer Dick's message."</p>

<p>With that thought in mind, and with no hope
behind it, Constance waylaid her father in the hall
the next morning as he was about to go out.</p>

<p>"Poppa, I want you to do something for me; no,
not that"&mdash;the elderly man was feeling in his
pockets for his check-book&mdash;"it is something very
different, this time; different and&mdash;and rather
dreadful. You remember the suicide you read
about, yesterday morning?"</p>

<p>"Did I read about one? Oh, yes; the man that
shot himself down on the Platte, or was it Cherry
Creek? The fellow I thought might be Dick's
friend. What about it?"</p>

<p>"It's that. We ought to make sure of it for
Dick's sake, you know. Won't you go to the
coroner's office and see if it is Mr. Jeffard? It's a
horrible thing to ask you to do, but"&mdash;</p>

<p>There was grim reminiscence in the old pioneer's
smile. "It won't be the first one I've seen that
died with his boots on. I'll go and locate your claim
for you."</p>

<p>She kissed him good-by, but he came back from
the gate to say: "Hold on, here; I don't know
your Mr. Jeffard from a side of sole leather. How
am I going to identify him?"</p>

<p>"You've seen him once," she explained. "Do
you remember the man who sat next to me the night
we went to hear 'The Bohemian Girl'?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>"The thirsty one that you and Myra made a bet
on? Yes, I recollect him."</p>

<p>"I don't think he was thirsty. Would you know
him if you were to see him again?"</p>

<p>"I guess maybe I would; I've seen him half a
dozen times since,&mdash;met him out here on the sidewalk
the next morning. Is that your man?"</p>

<p>"That was Mr. Jeffard," she affirmed, turning
away that he might not see the tears that welled up
unbidden.</p>

<p>"All right; I'll go and identify him for you."</p>

<p>So he said, and so he meant to do; but it proved
to be a rather exciting day at the Mining Exchange,
and he forgot the commission until he was
about to board a homeward-bound car in the evening.
Then he found that he was too late. The
body of the suicide had been shipped East in accordance
with telegraphic instructions received at noon.
When he made his report to Constance, she fell back
upon Tommie's assurance, and sent the delayed
answer to Bartrow's message, telling him that his
friend was dead.</p>

<p>Having sorrowfully recorded all these things in
the book of facts accomplished, it was not wonderful
that Constance, coming out of Margaret Gannon's
room late the following afternoon, should cover her
face and cry out in something akin to terror when
she cannoned against Jeffard at the turn in the
dingy hallway. Neither was it remarkable that her
strength should forsake her for the moment; nor
that Jeffard, seeing her plight, should forget his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
degradation and give her timely help by leading her
to a seat in the dusty window embrasure. At that
the conventionalities, or such shreds of them as
might still have bound either of them, parted asunder
in the midst, and for the time being they were
but a man and a woman, as God had created them.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so glad!" were her first words. "I&mdash;I
thought you were dead!"</p>

<p>"I ought to be," was his comment. "But what
made you think that?"</p>

<p>"It was in the newspaper&mdash;about the man who
shot himself. I was afraid it was you, and when
Tommie had been to see we were sure of it."</p>

<p>"In the newspaper?" he queried; and then, with
a ghost of a smile which was mirthless: "It was a
little previous, but so justifiable that I really ought
to take the hint. Can't you tell me more? I'm
immensely interested."</p>

<p>She told him everything from the beginning, concluding
with a pathetic little appeal for forgiveness
if she had done wrong in taking too much for
granted.</p>

<p>"You couldn't well do that," he hastened to say.
"And you mustn't ask forgiveness for motives
which an angel might envy. But it is casting pearls
before swine in my case, Miss Elliott. I have sown
the wind, deliberately and with malice aforethought,
and now I am reaping the whirlwind, and regretting
day by day that it doesn't develop sufficient violence
to finish that which it has begun."</p>

<p>"Please don't say that," she pleaded. "There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
are always hands stretched out to help us, if we
could but see and lay hold of them. Why won't
you let Dick help you when he is so anxious to do
it? You will, now that you know about it, won't
you?"</p>

<p>"I knew about it before. Lansdale told me, but
I made him promise to drop it. It isn't that I
wouldn't accept help from Bartrow as willingly as
I would from any one in the world; it is simply that
I don't care to take the chance of adding ingratitude
to my other ill-doings."</p>

<p>"Ingratitude?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The man who allows his friend to help
him in any crisis of his own making should at least
be able to give bond for his good behavior. I can't
do that now. I wouldn't trust myself to go across
the street. I know my own potentiality for evil too
well."</p>

<p>"But potentiality isn't evil," she protested. "It's
only the power to do things, good or bad. And if
one have that there is always hope."</p>

<p>"Not for me," he said shortly. "I have sinned
against grace."</p>

<p>"Who hasn't?" Constance rejoined. "But
grace doesn't die because it's sinned against."</p>

<p>He smiled again at that. "I think my particular
allotment of grace is dead beyond the hope of resurrection."</p>

<p>"How can that be?"</p>

<p>He put his back to the window so that he had not
to look in her eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"Grace for most men takes the form of an ideal.
So long as the condition to be attained is ahead
there is hope, but when one has turned his back
upon it"&mdash;</p>

<p>Indirection fences badly with open-eyed sincerity,
and he did not finish. But the door was open now,
and Constance meant to do her whole duty.</p>

<p>"I think I understand," she assented; "but I
wish you would be quite frank with me. In a way,
I am Mr. Bartrow's deputy, and if I have to tell him
you refuse to let him help you, I shall have to give
him a better reason than you have given me."</p>

<p>"You are inexorable," he said, and there was love
in his eyes, despite his efforts reasonward. "I wish
I dared tell you the whole miserable truth."</p>

<p>"And why may you not?"</p>

<p>"Because it concerns&mdash;a woman."</p>

<p>She shrank back a little at that, and he saw that
she had misunderstood. Wherefore he plunged
recklessly into the pool of frankness.</p>

<p>"The woman is a good woman," he went on
quickly, "and one day not so very long ago I loved
her well enough to believe that I could win my way
back to decency and uprightness for her sake. It
was a mistake. I had fallen lower than I knew,
and the devil came in for his own."</p>

<p>Here was something tangible to lay hold of at
last, and Connie made instant use of it.</p>

<p>"Does she know?" she asked.</p>

<p>The mirthless smile came and went again. "She
thinks she does."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>"But you haven't told her all; is that it?"</p>

<p>"I have tried to, but, being a good woman, she
can't understand. I think I didn't fully understand,
myself; but I do now."</p>

<p>"Is it so far beyond reparation?"</p>

<p>"It is indeed. If the devil's emissary who has
brought me to this pass could be exorcised this
moment I should never recover the lost ground of
self-respect. There is nothing to go back to. If I
had not to be despicable from necessity, I should
doubtless be so from choice."</p>

<p>"I think you are harder with yourself than you
would be with another. Can't you begin to believe
in yourself again? <i>I</i> believe in you."</p>

<p>"You!&mdash;but you don't know what you are
saying, Miss Elliott. See!"&mdash;his coat was buttoned
to the chin, tramp-wise, and he tore it open
to show her the rags that underlay it&mdash;"do you
understand now? I have pawned the shirt off my
back&mdash;not to satisfy the cravings of hunger, but to
feed a baser passion than that of the most avaricious
miser that ever lived. Do I make it plain that I
am not worthy of your sympathy, or of Richard
Bartrow's?"</p>

<p>For once the clear gray eyes were veiled, and her
chin quivered a little when she spoke. "You hurt
me more than I can tell," she said.</p>

<p>The dull rage of self-abasement in him flamed
into passion at the sight of what he had done, but
the bitter speech of it tarried at the sound of a
heavy step on the stair. Constance rose from her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
seat in the window embrasure with a nervous thrill
of embarrassment, but Jeffard relieved her at once.
There was a vacant room on the opposite side of the
corridor, and when the intruder appeared at the
stair-head, Miss Elliott was alone.</p>

<p>She glanced at the man as he passed, and Jeffard,
from his place behind the half-closed door of the
vacant room, saw her draw back, and clenched his
hands and swore softly, because, forsooth, she had
for some fleeting pulse-beat of time to breathe the
same air with the intruder. For he knew the man
as a purveyor for Peter Grim's house of dishonor;
a base thing for which wholesome speech has no
name.</p>

<p>What followed was without sequence. Almost at
the same instant the footsteps of the man ceased to
echo in the empty corridor, there was a cry half
angry and half of terror from Margaret Gannon's
room, and Miss Elliott disappeared from Jeffard's
limited field of vision. In the turning of a leaf
Jeffard was at the door of the room in the end of
the corridor. What he saw and heard made a man
of him for the moment. Margaret Gannon had evidently
been surprised at her sewing-machine; the
work was still under the needle, and the chair was
overturned. Margaret was crouching in the farthest
corner of the room, with Miss Elliott standing
over her like a small guardian angel at bay. The
nameless one had his back to the door, and Jeffard
heard only the conclusion of a jeering insult which
included both of the women.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>Now Jeffard had fasted for twenty-four hours,
and the quick dash to the end of the corridor made
him dizzy and faint; but red wrath, so it be
fierce enough, is its own elixir. Thinking of nothing
but that he should acquit himself as a man before
the woman he loved, he flung himself upon the
contemner of women with the vigor of a righteous
cause singing in his veins like the wine of new life.</p>

<p>The struggle was short and decisive. In his
college days Jeffard had been a man of his hands,
and the fierce onset proved to be the better half of
the battle. Constance caught her breath and cowered
in the corner with Margaret when the two men went
down together, but she gave a glad little cry when
she saw that Jeffard had won the fall; that he had
wrenched the drawn pistol from the other's grasp
and flung it harmless across the room. Then there
was another and a fiercer grapple on the floor, and
Jeffard's fist rose and fell like a blacksmith's hammer
with the dodging head of his antagonist for its anvil.</p>

<p>The end of it was as abrupt as the beginning.
In the midst of another wrestling bout the beaten
one freed himself, bounded to his feet, and darted
into the corridor with Jeffard at his heels. There
was a sharp scurry of racing feet in the hall, a
prolonged crash as of a heavy body falling down the
stair, and Jeffard was back again, panting with the
violence of it, but with eyes alight and an apology on
his lips.</p>

<p>Constance ran to meet him and cut the apology
short.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"The idea!" she protested; "when it was for
Margaret's sake and mine! Are you sure you're
not hurt?"</p>

<p>Jeffard's knuckles were cut and bleeding, but he
kept that hand behind him.</p>

<p>"It's the other fellow who is hurt, I hope."
Then to Margaret: "Do you know him? Are you
afraid of him?"</p>

<p>Margaret glanced at Constance and hesitated.
"He'll not be troubling me any more, I'm thinking.
It's Pete Grim that sent him; and he was at me
before I knew."</p>

<p>Jeffard picked up the captured weapon and put it
on the sewing-machine.</p>

<p>"Take that to him if he comes again when you
are alone. Miss Elliott, please stay here a moment
until I can go down and see that the way is clear."</p>

<p>He was gone at the word, but he had barely
reached the window with the dusty embrasure when
she overtook him. There was a sweet shyness in
her manner now, and he trembled as he had not in
any stage of the late encounter.</p>

<p>"Mr. Jeffard," she began, "will you forgive me
if I say that you have disproved all the hard things
you were trying to say of yourself? You'll let me
wire Dick, now, won't you?"</p>

<p>He shook his head because he was afraid to trust
himself to speak. As between an abject appeal
with his hopeless passion for its motive, and a
plunge back into the abyss of degradation which
would efface the temptation, there was nothing to
choose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>"You will at least promise me that you will consider
it," she went on. "I can't ask less."</p>

<p>If he did not reply immediately it was because he
was trying to fix her image so that he should always
be able to think of her just as she stood, with the
afternoon sunlight falling upon her face, irradiating
it and making a shimmering halo of the red-brown
hair and deep wells of the clear gray eyes. A
vagrant thought came to him: that it was worth
a descent into the nether depths to have such a
woman seek him out and plead with him for his
soul's sake. He put it aside to deny her entreaty.</p>

<p>"I can't promise even that."</p>

<p>She was silent for a moment, and embarrassment
came back and fought for holding-ground when she
tried to bring herself to do the thing which compassion
suggested. But compassion won; and Jeffard
looked on with a half-cynical smile when she took a
gold coin from her purse and offered it to him.</p>

<p>"Just for the present," she begged, with a beseeching
look which might have melted a worse man.</p>

<p>He took the money, and the smile ended in an
unpleasant laugh.</p>

<p>"You think I ought to refuse, and so I ought;
as any man would who had a spark of manhood left
in him. But that is why I take it; I have been
trying to make you understand that I am not worth
saving. Do I make it plain to you?"</p>

<p>"You make me very sorry," she quavered; and
because her sorrow throttled speech, she turned and
left him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">After</span> Constance had gone, Jeffard had an exceedingly
bad half-hour. For a time he tramped
up and down the deserted corridor, calling himself
hard names and likening his latest obliquity to
whatsoever unpardonable sin has been recorded
against the most incorrigible of mankind. Love
had its word, also&mdash;outraged love, acknowledged
only to be openly flouted and spat upon; for one
may neither do violence to a worthy passion, nor
give rein to an unworthy, without paying for it,
blow for blow. What would she think of him?
What could she think, save that she had wasted her
sympathy on a shameless vagabond who had sought
to palm himself off on her and her friends as a
gentleman?</p>

<p>The thought of it was stifling. The air of the
musty hallway seemed suddenly to grow suffocating,
and the muffled drumming of the sewing-machine in
Margaret Gannon's room jarred upon him until it
drove him forth to wander hot-hearted and desperate
in the streets.</p>

<p>Without remembering that he had crossed the
viaduct or ascended the hill, he finally found himself
wandering in the Highlands. Drifting aimlessly
on beyond the fringe of suburban houses, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
came to the borders of a shallow pond what time the
sun was poising for its plunge behind the upreared
mountain background in the west. It was here,
when he had flung himself down upon the warm
brown earth in utter weariness of soul and body,
that his good angel came once more and wrestled
with him.</p>

<p>Looking backward he saw that the angle of the
inclined plane had grown suddenly precipitous
within a fortnight. Since the night of his quarrel
with the well-meaning miner, the baize door at the
head of the carpeted stair had been closed to him.
In consequence he had been driven to the lair of
a less carefully groomed but more rapacious wild
beast whose keeper offered his patrons a choice
between the more serious business of the gaming-tables,
and the lighter diversions of a variety theatre.
Jeffard had seen the interior of the Bijou on
the earliest of his investigative expeditions in Denver,
and had gone away sick at heart at the sight of
it. Wherefore it was a measure of the depths to
which he had descended that he could become an habitue
of the place, caring nothing for the misery and
depravity which locked arms with all who breathed
its tainted atmosphere.</p>

<p>It was at the Bijou that he had lost the better
part of the winnings rescued by the miner's bit of
charitable by-play; and it was there, also, that he
had thrown away the major portion of a second gift
from Lansdale. For two nights in succession the
lack of money had kept him away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>He took out Connie's offering and stared at it
with lack-lustre eyes. With heedful manipulation
here was the fuel to feed the fire of his besetting
passion for some hours. Having permitted her to
give and himself to take it, why should he quibble
at the manner of its spending? When he saw
that hesitancy implied another attempt to turn back
at the eleventh hour, he felt that this was no longer
possible. Try as he might, the shame of this last
infamous thing would reach out and drag him back
into the mire.</p>

<p>The alternative disposed of, the matter simplified
itself. He had only to determine whether he should
end it all before or after he had flung away this bit
of yellow metal. The decision was so nicely balanced
that he let it turn upon the flipping of the
coin&mdash;heads for a sudden plunge into the pond,
tails for a final bout with chance and the plunge
afterward.</p>

<p>He spun the gold piece, and went down on his
hands and knees to read the oracle in the fading
light. It was the misshapen eagle that stared back
at him from the face of the coin, and he took his
reprieve sullenly, calling his evil genius a usurer.</p>

<p>He got upon his feet stiffly and turned his face
toward the city. Then it occurred to him that it
would be well to make his preparations while he
could see. There was a house building on the little
knoll above the pond; a brick and the binding-string
from a bundle of lath would serve; and when
he had secured them he sounded the pond around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
the edges with a stick. It was too shallow; but
from a plank thrown across to the head of the
drainage flume it proved deep enough, and here he
left the brick and the bit of tarred twine.</p>

<p>Half an hour later he entered the Bijou. On the
threshold he met the proprietor; and when he would
have passed with a nod, Grim barred the way.</p>

<p>"Been layin' for you," announced the man of vice,
sententiously. "Come into the box-office."</p>

<p>Jeffard obeyed mechanically. He was in the
semi-stupor which anticipates the delirium of the
gaming fever, and the man's voice sounded afar off.
Grim led the way behind the bar to a windowless
den furnished with a roll-top desk and two chairs.
Closing the door, he waved Jeffard to a seat.</p>

<p>"Been sort o' sizin' you up lately, and I put it up
that you're out o' luck. Does that call the turn?"</p>

<p>"I don't know how that concerns you," said Jeffard,
with a sudden access of dull resentment.</p>

<p>"No more do I; but that's neither here nor
yonder. You're down on your luck, ain't you?"</p>

<p>Jeffard nodded. "Call it that, if you like."</p>

<p>"Thought so. Broke most of the time, I reckon?"</p>

<p>"Yes; most of the time."</p>

<p>"Jes' so. Well, I'm goin' to put you on to a soft
snap. I know all about you&mdash;who you are, where
you come from, and all the rest. You've been
playin' to lose right along, and now I'm goin' to
give you a tip so you can play to win ever' time.
See?"</p>

<p>Jeffard came out of his abstraction sufficiently to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
wonder what the man was driving at. "Make it
short," he rejoined curtly.</p>

<p>Grim leaned back in his pivot-chair, and his hard
face wrinkled under an evil smile.</p>

<p>"Don't be in a rush. Game runs all night, and
you'll have plenty of time to go and blow in whatever
you've got after I get through with you. Or,
if you can't wait, go and blow it first, and we'll
talk business afterwards."</p>

<p>"No," Jeffard objected sullenly. "If you have
anything to say to me, say it now."</p>

<p>"Business before pleasure, eh? All right; here's
the lay-out. I'm goin' to stake you with a suit o'
good clothes, pay your board at the Albany or the
Brown, whichever you like, and give you a roll to
flash up that'll make you feel flush ever' time you
look at it. Then"&mdash;</p>

<p>Jeffard's gesture was of impatience.</p>

<p>"Never mind about the details. What is the
price of all this?"</p>

<p>"Mighty nigh nothin' at all. You had plenty o'
friends a while back, and you'll have 'em again, as
soon as you're flush. And when any of 'em feel
like proddin' the tagger, why&mdash;you know where
he's kep'; that's all."</p>

<p>While one might draw a breath there was murder
in Jeffard's heart; in his weakness a rage that was
childish in its vehemence took possession of him,
and he covered his face with his hands to crush
back the hot tears of impotence which sprang up
and blinded him. Grim looked on unpityingly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
waiting for what he conceived to be the inevitable.
When Jeffard struggled to his feet, his face was
white and he had to steady himself by the back of
the chair.</p>

<p>"I thought I'd got to the bottom when I came
here to-night," he began unsteadily, "but you've
shown me my mistake. Thank God, I can yet say
No to you, low as I am. Let me get out of here."</p>

<p>Knowing the strength of the gambler's chain, as
well as the length thereof, Grim held his peace; and
Jeffard pushed past the bar-tender and went out
through the small door at the end of the bar. On
the sidewalk a crowd beset the theatre entrance, and
out of the midst of it came two men, striking and
clutching at each other as they fought their way
into the clear. Within arm's-length of Jeffard
they separated. He saw the sheen of the electric
light on a weapon, and darted between them in time
to spoil the aim of the man who drew first. There
was a flash and a report, a rush on the part of the
crowd, and Jeffard found himself dodging and
doubling swiftly through dark alleys and crooked
covered ways, following the lead of the man whose
life he had saved. After a time they came out in a
silent street where there was light.</p>

<p>"Didn't know me, did you, pardner?" quoth
the fugitive, relaxing his grasp on Jeffard's wrist.
"Like as not you wouldn't 'a' done it if you had,
but that don't saw no wood with me. That greaser
had the drop on me, sure's yer born."</p>

<p>Whereupon Jeffard looked again, and recognizing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
his friendly enemy of the winning night, was glad,
inasmuch as he had been able to cancel an obligation.
None the less, his reply was ungracious
enough.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's you, is it? Well, we're quits now.
Good-night."</p>

<p>He turned and walked away, but at the corner the
man overtook him. "Not that-a-way," he forbade,
pointing up the street. "Somebody in the crowd'll
be sure to know you, and you'll walk slap back into
trouble after I done drug you out. The p'lice are
there by this time, an' they don't care who, so they
get a man 'r two to lock up."</p>

<p>Jeffard nodded, and made a circuit of the dangerous
locality with his head up and the light of a
steadfast purpose in his eyes. Whatever of vacillation
there was in him an hour earlier had been thoroughly
flailed out in the brief interview with Peter
Grim. He knew now what he had to do, and the
precise manner of its doing.</p>

<p>Keeping to the quieter streets, he came out in
front of the St. James; and dodging the crowded
lobby, made his way to the writing-room. Since he
dare not go to the clerk for stationery, he was compelled
to wait until some one left what he required.
The chance befell presently, but when he came to
write his note to Constance Elliott the thing was
harder to do than he had prefigured it. What he
finally wrote, after he had spoiled two of the three
sheets of paper left by his predecessor in the chair
at the writing-table, was this:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>"After what happened this afternoon, you will
not think worse of me if I ask you to let me try to
explain what must seem to you too despicable to be
remembered. I can't hope to make you understand
without being frank, and when, at some future time,
you may learn the circumstances under which this is
written, I shall hope for forgiveness.</p>

<p>"You may remember that I said I couldn't tell
you the truth, because it concerns a woman. When
I add that the woman is yourself, you will understand.
I love you; I think I have been loving you
ever since that evening which you said we were to
forget&mdash;the evening at the theatre. Strangely
enough, my love for you isn't strong in the strength
which saves. I went from you that night when you
had bidden me God-speed at Mrs. Calmaine's, and
within the hour I was once more a penniless vagabond.</p>

<p>"When you were trying to help me this afternoon,
I was trying to keep from saying that which I
could never have a right to say. You pressed me
very hard in your sweet innocence and loving sympathy,&mdash;you
see, I am quite frank,&mdash;and when you
finally gave me a chance to make the impossible
thing that I longed to say still more impossible, I
took it in sheer desperation. Nay, more; I purposed
in my heart to so desecrate your gift as to
make the thought of my love for you an unhallowed
memory.</p>

<p>"That is all, I think, save, when it came to the
brink, I found that there was still a deeper depth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
which was yet unplumbed, and which I trust I shall
have the courage to leave unexplored."</p>

<p>When it was finished he wrapped the gold piece
in a bit of paper, and, putting it in the envelope
with the note, set out to find the house in Colfax
Avenue. Having seen it but once, and that in daylight,
it was not singular that it eluded him in the
night; but it was surely the very irony of chance
which led him to slip the envelope under the front
door of a house two squares beyond that occupied
by the Elliotts, and which kept him from noticing
the placard "For Rent" nailed upon the very door
under which he thrust his message to Constance.</p>

<p>This single preliminary set in order, he faced
once more toward the Highlands, lagging a little
from sheer weariness as he went, but finding comfort
in the thought that there would be infinite surcease
from hunger and exhaustion at the end of this
last pilgrimage.</p>

<p>There was time for reflection on the way, and he
marvelled that his thoughts dwelt so persistently
upon the trivial details of the thing he was about to
do. He was a practiced swimmer; would the weight
of a single brick be sufficient to overcome the instinct
of self-preservation which might assert itself
at the last moment? Probably, since he was weak
from fasting, and would be encumbered with his
clothing. Then another suggestion came to torment
him: If he should tie the brick to his feet, as he
had thought to, the water might not be deep enough,
after all. Consequently, he must fasten it about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
his neck. And thereupon he had a fit of creeping
horror at the thought of drowning with his face
dragged down into the ooze and slime of the
bottom.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, when he came to the brink of the
pool these things ceased to trouble him; though even
there it was impossible to turn the current of thought
into a reflective channel. He made the effort for
decency's sake. It was not meet that a thinking
being should go out of life like the brutes that
perish; without a thought for the past with its lacks
and havings, or the future with its untried possibilities.
But the effort returned to him void, and
presently he stumbled upon the reason: the premeditated
fact of self-murder shut him off alike from
repentance for what had gone before, and from hope
in what should come after.</p>

<p>Very good, he said; and flung himself down to
make the most of the present. He was faint and
weary, and it would be ill to drown a tired body.
There was no moon, but the midsummer night was
clear and still. The stars burned steadily overhead,
and there was a soft light abroad which seemed to
be a part of the atmosphere. Over in the west the
black bulk of the range rose up to meet the sky;
and poised above one of the highest peaks the planet
Mars swung to its setting. Jeffard marked it, saying
it should be his executioner; that when the rosy
point of light should touch the black sky-line, he
would rise up and go to his place.</p>

<p>Meanwhile it was soothing to lie stretched out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
upon the warm earth with no human future to prefigure,
and no past insistent enough to disturb one
with its annals. And there was still the present,
with its soft light and its dim hemisphere of sky;
its balmy air and its vague and shadowy horizon.
It was good to be alone with nature in these last
few moments; to have done with the tiresome world
of man's marring; to be quit of man's presence.</p>

<p>The thought had scarcely shaped itself when it
was made of none effect by the appearance of a man
at the top of the little knoll. The intruder came
straight on, as if in no doubt as to his purpose, and
sitting down on the end of the plank bridge, proceeded
to fill and light his pipe without saying a
word. Jeffard caught a glimpse of a bearded face
by the flare of the match, and said, "Oh, it's you
again, is it?"</p>

<p>"Right you are, pardner. Hope I ain't intrudin'."</p>

<p>"I suppose you have as good a right here as I
have. But I might suggest that the night is fine
and the world large, and that there are times when
a man has no use for his fellows."</p>

<p>The new-comer smoked in silence for a full minute
before he removed his pipe to say:&mdash;</p>

<p>"That's a sort of a gilt-edged invitation for me
to mog off, ain't it? All right; I'll go pretty
middlin' quick; but I've been fool enough to tramp
somewheres nigh ten mile behind you to-night for to
get a show to say what's on my mind; wher'fore,
I'll say it first and vamoose afte'wards."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>Jeffard gave him leave, watching the narrowing
margin between the star and the mountain-top.</p>

<p>"Well, b'iled down, it's just about this: I know
what you're out yere for,&mdash;seen it in your eye back
yonder on the street corner,&mdash;but I says to myself,
'Jim Garvin, you go kinder slow; it ain't none
o' your business. When a man takes a mill-run o'
hisself and finds out the claim ain't worth workin'
no longer, w'y, it's his funeral, and none o' yourn.'
And then again I says to myself, 'Maybe that there
feller hain't got nary 'nother claim&mdash;leastwise, not
as he knows of,' and so I follered you, all over the
blame' town and out yere."</p>

<p>Jeffard made no reply, and the intruder went on.</p>

<p>"'Course, you understand I ain't a-mixin' up any
in your business, not if I know it. You just listen
at what I'm goin' to say, and then if you want to
go ahead, w'y, all right, do it; and I'll loan you
my gun so 't you won't have to get yourself wet in
cold water. Is that about right?"</p>

<p>"Go on," said Jeffard.</p>

<p>"Well, it's this-a-way; I'm off on a prospectin'
tower to-morrow. Blowed in ever' last thing I had,
and took a grub-stake, same as heretofore. Now
the old man that puts up the grub-stake, he says,
says he, 'Jim, you'll want a pardner. It's gettin'
pretty late in the season, and you won't stand no
kind of a chance goin' alone.' 'Right you are,' says
I,' and I'll pick up some feller on the range as I go
in.' 'Good enough,' says he. 'I'll make this here
order big enough to stake the two of you.' That's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
the whole lay-out, and you're the pardner, if you
say the word. You don't know beans about me,
and I don't know you from Adam's off ox, so that's
a stand-off. What do you say?"</p>

<p>Jeffard did not answer until there was but a bare
thread of sky between the star and the peak. Then
he said: "Do you happen to have a coin of any
kind about you?"</p>

<p>Garvin tossed a dollar across to him, and Jeffard
spun it. Then he found that he had no match, and
asked the miner to give him one. Garvin watched
him curiously as he bent over the coin and struck
the match.</p>

<p>"The luck's against me&mdash;it's heads," he announced
gravely. "I'll go with you."</p>

<p>Garvin rose and stretched himself stiffly.</p>

<p>"You're a cool one," he commented. "What if
it'd been tails?"</p>

<p>Jeffard got up and kicked the brick into the
pond. "In that case I should have been obliged to
ask you to lend me your pistol. Let's go back to
town and get something to eat with that dollar. I
haven't had anything since last night."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">After</span> toiling all night through black gorges and
over unspeakable mountain passes, the narrow-gauge
train from Denver, headed by two pygmy locomotives,
came out into daylight, sunshine, and wider
horizons at Alta Vista. In the sleeping-car three
sections had been transformed by the drowsy porter
into daytime smugness, and three persons&mdash;two of
them in deference to the enthusiasm of the third&mdash;were
up and dressed.</p>

<p>"Isn't it all perfectly indescribable?" Myra
was saying, when the engineer of one of the pygmies
sounded the whistle for the station. "Do you
know, I couldn't go to sleep for hours last night,
late as it was. I put up the window curtain and
piled the pillows in the corner so I could look out.
The sky was like a great inverted bowl lined with
black velvet and spangled with diamonds, circling
around us as we darted around the curves. And
in the open places there was always a solemn procession
of cliffs and peaks, marching with us sometimes,
and then turning to slip past again when the
bowl whirled the other way. Oh, but it was grand!"</p>

<p>"I'm glad it lays hold of you," said Connie, who
was loyally jealous for the scenic renown of her
native Colorado. "Now you know why I wouldn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
let you go on any of those breathless little one-day
excursions from Denver. They just take you up in
a balloon, give you a glimpse while you gasp, and
drop you without a parachute. The tourist people
all make them, you know,&mdash;it's in the itinerary,
with a coupon in the cute little morocco-bound book
of tickets,&mdash;and they come back wild-eyed and
desperate, and go without their suppers to scribble
incoherent notes about the 'Cache la Platte' and
'Clear Poudre Canyon,' and other ridiculous things.
It would be funny if it wasn't so exasperating."</p>

<p>Myra nodded. "I'm beginning to 'savez,' as
Mr. Bartrow would say. By the way, isn't this
the place where he was to meet us?&mdash;Why, yes;
there he is now!" She waved her hand and struggled
with the window-latch as the train drew up to
the platform.</p>

<p>He was with them in a moment, carrying a towel-covered
basket, and a tin coffee-pot which he waved
gingerly by way of salutation.</p>

<p>"The top o' the morning to you all," he said,
beaming genially. "I was afraid you wouldn't be
up, and then my hot coffee would be cold coffee,
and I'd get myself disliked." Then to the drowsy
porter: "John, you scoundrel, get us a table before
I break you in two and throw you out of the
window."</p>

<p>The table was promptly forthcoming, and Myra
made room in the narrow seat for Bartrow.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," he begged, laughing, "I'd like to,
but I can't. Somebody's got to stand up and do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
the swing-rack act with this coffee-pot. Just unload
that basket, will you, Elliott, and I'll play head
waiter while you set the table."</p>

<p>The breakfast was good, and there was a most
astonishing variety. Moreover the coffee rose to a
degree of excellence which more than atoned for the
admixture of condensed milk in lieu of cream, and
for the slight resinous taste imparted by the new tin
cups. Bartrow apologized for the cups.</p>

<p>"You see, I left the mine rather middling early
this morning, and packed things in a hurry. When
I was making the coffee over Jim Bryant's stove
here at Alta Vista, it struck me all at once that I'd
forgotten the cups. The train was in sight, and
Jim had only one, and that hadn't been washed for
a month of Sundays. Maybe you think I wasn't
stampeded for about a minute."</p>

<p>Connie laughed. "I suppose you went out and
robbed somebody."</p>

<p>"That's what I did; made a break for the store,
and found it locked up, of course. I had to smash
a window to get what I wanted."</p>

<p>"Why, you lawless man!" protested Myra, trying
to make room on the narrow table for the contents
of the inexhaustible basket. "Where in the world
did you get such a variety of things?"</p>

<p>"Canned goods," Connie cut in maliciously; "all
canned goods, put out in dishes so you won't be
reminded of the tinny taste. Everybody lives on
canned goods in the mountains."</p>

<p>"Connie, you make me tired," Bartrow retorted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
bracing himself as the train whisked around a sharp
curve. "Just dig a little deeper and get out that
platter of trout; they've never seen the inside of a
can."</p>

<p>"Never mind what Connie says; she isn't responsible,"
said Myra. "The breakfast is just as
good as it can be. Besides, you know you promised
us that we should live just as you do if we'd visit
the Little Myriad. I wish you'd put that coffee-pot
on the floor and sit down with us."</p>

<p>Bartrow tried it, and found it possible; after
which the talk became general and cheerful over the
resinous coffee cups and the lurching dishes. In a
lull Elliott asked how the Little Myriad was going
on.</p>

<p>"Good enough for anybody," rejoined Bartrow,
with enthusiasm alert. "Lead opens out better
every day, and we're in only about seventy-five
feet."</p>

<p>"No pay-dirt yet, of course," said the older man.</p>

<p>"Well, hardly; not yet. I'm figuring on a hundred
and fifty feet of development work at the very
least before we begin to take out pay."</p>

<p>"Mr. Bartrow, don't you remember that another
thing you promised was that you wouldn't talk
mineral-English before me without explaining it?"
Myra broke in. "I want to know"&mdash;An unexpected
plunge of the car made her grasp at the
coffee cup, and Connie slipped deftly into the break.</p>

<p>"And it shall know, bless its inquisitive little
soul! It shall be stuffed with information like a fat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
little pillow with feathers. But not here, cuzzy
dear. Wait till we're on the ground, and then I'll
go off out of hearing, and Dick may turn himself
into a glossary, or an intelligence office, or a personal
conductor, or anything else you'd like to have
him."</p>

<p>Bartrow looked unspeakable things, and put down
his knife and fork to say, "Connie, you're a&mdash;a"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Brute, Dickie; say it right out, and don't spare
me on Myra's account. She rather enjoys it; she
loves to hear people abuse me."</p>

<p>"Connie, you are perfectly incorrigible," said
Myra severely. "With your poor people you are
an angel of light, but with your friends"&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'm an angel of darkness. That's right, cuzzy
dear; pile it on, I'm young and strong. Poppa,
can't you think of something mean to say about me?
Do try, please."</p>

<p>Bartrow grinned; and Elliott, who knew his
daughter's vagaries and delighted in them, laughed
outright. Constance made a face across the table
at her cousin, and said, "Now talk mines, if you
can."</p>

<p>"I shall," asserted Myra calmly. "Mr. Bartrow,
how did you ever come to call your mine the 'Little
Myriad'?"</p>

<p>If the bottom had suddenly dropped out of his
coffee cup, Bartrow could not have been more disconcerted.
Constance, who was in his secret,
laughed gleefully, and clapped her hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tell her, Dick; tell her all about it. If you
don't I shall."</p>

<p>Bartrow stammered and stumbled until Connie
went into ecstasies of mischievous delight. After
two or three helpless beginnings, he said, rather
tamely, "I thought it was a pretty name."</p>

<p>"But it's so odd; a myriad is many, and a mine
is only one."</p>

<p>"Oh, the meaning didn't have anything to do
with it," rejoined Bartrow, going straight to his own
discomfiture with refreshing candor. "It was the&mdash;the
suggestion; the similarity; the&mdash;By Jove!
we're there at last; this is the mine switch."</p>

<p>The exclamation was a heartfelt thanksgiving,
and in the confusion of debarking the perilous topic
was safely eluded. It was a sharp climb of some
distance from the railway track to the mine, and
Elliott developed unsuspected reserves of tact by
leading the way with Miss Van Vetter, leaving Bartrow
to follow with Constance. When they had
lagged sufficiently behind the others, and were yet
out of earshot of the men who were following with
the luggage, Bartrow went back to the unexploded
petard.</p>

<p>"Connie, you've just got to help me out now,"
he declared. "What shall I tell her if she tackles
me again?"</p>

<p>"Tell her the truth."</p>

<p>"I don't dare to."</p>

<p>"Then tell her a fib. But no&mdash;on second
thought I shouldn't do that, if I were you; you'd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
only make a mess of it. I'll tell you what to do:
just fight shy of it till I can get her to myself. I
promise you she'll never ask you about the Little
Myriad's christening again as long as she lives."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Bartrow, with the air of a reprieved
criminal; and then dubiously: "See here,
Connie, how are you going to do it? No monkey
business, you know."</p>

<p>"Not a single, solitary monkey," she answered so
soberly that Bartrow forgot his suspicions, and
plunged into another subject which was also near
to his heart.</p>

<p>"About Jeffard; how did you come to think he
had shot himself?"</p>

<p>"It was only one of those suppositions you think
you have verified when you've only been playing
blind-man's bluff with it. The similarity of names
misled me at first."</p>

<p>"But afterward you merely wired that you were
mistaken. Was that another supposition?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no; I saw him and talked with him."</p>

<p>"The mischief you did! What did he have to
say for himself?"</p>

<p>"Not much that will bear repeating. I'm too
sorry for him to want to talk about it, Dick."</p>

<p>Bartrow wondered, and kept his wonder to himself.
What he said was in the nature of worldly
wisdom.</p>

<p>"Jeffard'll come out all right in the end. He's
as obstinate as a pig, but that's the only swinish
thing about him. I'm afraid he'll have to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
through the stamp-mill and get himself pulverized;
but when it comes to the clean-up there'll be more
good metal than tailings. Don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"How should I know?" queried Constance.</p>

<p>"I didn't ask you what you know; I asked what
you thought about it."</p>

<p>"You forget that we've met only two or three
times."</p>

<p>"I don't forget anything. But I know you can
size a man up while the rest of us are trying to get
acquainted with him. Don't you believe that Jeffard
will come out all right in the end?"</p>

<p>She was silent for a minute or two, and when she
answered there was a tremulous note in her voice
which was new to Bartrow.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid he has made that and everything
else impossible, Dick. I told you I had seen him
and talked with him; that was the day after I telegraphed
you about the suicide, nearly two months
ago. From that day to this he has not been seen
or heard of in Denver, so far as Tommie can find
out."</p>

<p>"Pshaw! Then you think he has taken the short
cut out of it, after all?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what to think," said Constance;
and as they were at the top of the steep trail, the
subject was dropped.</p>

<p>On the whole, Connie's apprehensions that her
cousin's urban upbringing might make her a difficult
guest for the young miner were apparently groundless.
Miss Van Vetter rhapsodized over the scenery;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
waded cheerfully through the dripping tunnel of the
Little Myriad to the very heading, in order to see
with her own eyes the vein of mineral; thought
Bartrow's three-room log cabin was good enough for
any one; and ate the dishes of Wun Ling's preparing
as though a Chinese cook were a necessary
adjunct to every well regulated household. When
the first day of exhilarating sight-seeing came to an
end, and the two young women were together in
their room, Connie bethought her of her promise to
Bartrow.</p>

<p>"By the way, Myra, did you find out how the
Little Myriad came by its name?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No; I forgot to ask Mr. Bartrow again."</p>

<p>"I can tell you, if you'd really like to know."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"He was going to call it the 'Myra,' and he asked
me if I thought you'd object. I told him you
would,&mdash;most emphatically. Then he said he would
call it the 'Myriad,' because that was the only word
he could think of that was anything like Myra."</p>

<p>Miss Van Vetter was arranging her hair before
the small mirror at the other end of the room, and
Constance waited long for her rejoinder. When it
came it was rather irrelevant.</p>

<p>"I've heard of people who could read your
thoughts better than you could think them," she
said; and Connie was too sleepy to strike back.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a week after the arrival of his visitors, Bartrow
had scant time and less inclination for troublement
about such purely mundane affairs as the
driving of tunnels and the incidental acquisition of
wealth thereby. There were burro journeys to the
top of the pass, and to the sheer cliff known to
the prosaic frontiersmen as the devil's jumping-off-place;
excursions afoot down the mountain to the
cool depths of Chipeta Canyon, and to Silver Lake
beyond the shrugged shoulder of Lost Creek Mountain;
and finally there was a breath-cutting climb to
the snow-patched summit of El Reposo, undertaken
for the express purpose of enabling Myra Van Vetter
to say that she had been where there was reason to
presume that no human being had preceded her.</p>

<p>These things three of them did, leaving Stephen
Elliott to his own devices, in accordance with the
set terms upon which he had consented to father the
<i>parti carré</i>. "Go on and climb your mountains and
just leave me out," he would say, when the preparations
were making for the day's jaunt. "I've had
my share of it, off and on, while I was hunting for
something I hadn't lost. Dick, here, hasn't any
better sense than to humor you; but you'd tramp
mighty little if I had to go along."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>Whereupon he would plant his chair for the day
upon the slab-floored porch of the cabin, tilt it to a
comfortable angle against the wall, and while away
the hours smoking a mellow pipe and reading the
day-old Denver paper painstakingly, from the top of
the title page to the bottom of the last want column.</p>

<p>Thus the crystalline autumn days winged their
flight, and Bartrow squired the two young women
hither and yon, and finally to the top of El Reposo,
as recorded. This excursion was the climax, from a
scenic point of view; and Myra, having long since
exhausted her vocabulary of superlatives, was unusually
silent.</p>

<p>"What's come over you? are you gorged with
mountains?" queried Connie sympathetically, slipping
her arm around her cousin's waist.</p>

<p>"It isn't that; it's just that I'm too full for
utterance, I think; or perhaps I should say too
empty of words to do it justice. How flippantly
trivial everything human seems in the face of such a
landscape! Here are we, three inconsequent atoms,
standing brazenly in the face of great nature, and
trying to gather some notion of the infinite into our
finite little souls. It's sheer impertinence."</p>

<p>"They won't mind," rejoined Bartrow, with a
comprehensive gesture, meant to include the mountains,
singular and collective; "they're used to it&mdash;the
impertinence, I mean. What you see is the face
of nature, as you say, and man doesn't seem to be
in it. Just the same, there is a small army of men
scattered among these overgrown hills, each with an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
inquisitive pick and shovel, backed by hardihood
enough to dare anything for the sake of adding
something to the wealth of the world."</p>

<p>Myra turned her back on the prospect and
searched Bartrow's eyes in a way to make him wonder
what was wrong with his well-turned little
speech.</p>

<p>"That is the first insincere thing I ever heard you
say," she asserted. "As if you didn't know that
not one of these men ever wastes a second thought
upon the world or the people in it, or upon anything
outside of his own little circle of ambitions and
cravings!"</p>

<p>"You're quite right," admitted Bartrow, abashed
and more than willing to stand corrected in any field
entered by Miss Van Vetter; but Constance took
up the cudgels on the other side.</p>

<p>"You make me exceedingly weary, you two,"
she said, with seraphic sweetness. "Neither of you
knows what you are talking about half the time, and
when you do, it isn't worth telling. Now listen to
me while I show you how ridiculous you are,"&mdash;Bartrow
sat down on a flat-topped boulder, and
made a dumb show of stopping his ears,&mdash;"I contend
that nearly every one of these poor prospectors
you've been maligning is a perfect monument
of unselfishness. He is working and starving and
hoping and enduring for somebody else in nine cases
out of ten. It's a wife, or a family, or an old father
or mother, or the mortgage on the farm, or some
other good thing."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>Myra made a snowball and threw it at Connie
the eloquent. "I think El Reposo is misnamed,"
she contended. "It ought to be called the Mount
of Perversity. Mr. Bartrow, you are sitting upon
the table, which is very undignified. Please move
and let us see what Wun Ling has stowed away in
the haversack."</p>

<p>They spread their luncheon on the flat-topped
boulder, and fell upon it like the hungry wayfarers
that they were, calling it a sky banquet, and drinking
Wun Ling's health in a bottle of cold tea. With
satiety came thoughts of the descent, and Myra
pleaded piteously for a change of route.</p>

<p>"I shall never get down the way we came up
in the wide, wide world,&mdash;not alive," she asserted.
"With the view in prospect, I believe I could climb
the Matterhorn; but getting down is quite another
matter. Can't we go around some other way?"</p>

<p>Bartrow thought it possible; but since Miss Van
Vetter had particularly desired to stand upon the
summit of a hitherto unexplored peak, he was not
sure.</p>

<p>"But we can try," said Myra. "At the worst
we can come back and creep down the way we came
up."</p>

<p>Bartrow glanced at his watch, and focused the
field-glass on a diaphanous cloud slipping stealthily
across the serrated summits of the main range away
to the westward.</p>

<p>"Yes, we can do that, if we have time," he assented.
"But I'm a little afraid of the weather.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
That cloud may miss us by twenty miles; and then
again, it may take a straight shoot across the valley
and make us very wet and uncomfortable."</p>

<p>Constance came to the rescue with a compromise.</p>

<p>"You go and prospect for a new trail, Dick, and
we'll stay here. If you find one you can come back
for us, and if you don't we'll be fresh for the
scramble down the other way."</p>

<p>Bartrow said it was well, and immediately set
about putting the suggestion into effect. When
he was fairly out of sight over the curvature of El
Reposo's mighty shoulder, Myra said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"He's good, isn't he?"</p>

<p>"He is a man among men, Myra; a man to tie
to, as we say here in Colorado."</p>

<p>They were sitting together on the flat boulder,
and Miss Van Vetter stole a side glance at her
cousin's profile. "You have known him a long time,
haven't you, Connie?"</p>

<p>"Almost ever since I can remember. I'm Colorado-born,
you know, and he isn't; but he came
across the plains in the days of the ox-teams, when
he was a little fellow, and the first work he ever
did was for poppa, when we lived on the ranch below
Golden."</p>

<p>"He is a self-made man, isn't he?"</p>

<p>"Don't say that, Myra, please. I hate the word.
God makes us, and circumstances or our own foolishness
mar us. But Dick is self-educated, so far as
he is educated at all. He was a homeless waif when
he first saw the Rockies. His father died in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
middle of the trip across the plains, and his mother
lived only long enough to have her grave dug some
two hundred miles farther west. The others took
care of Dick and brought him along with them to
Colorado because there wasn't anything else to do;
and since, Dick has made his own way, doing any
honest thing that came to his hand."</p>

<p>"He couldn't do the other kind," Myra averred.
"But you spoke of his education as if he hadn't
any. I suppose that was one of your 'exuberances,'
as Uncle Stephen calls them. Mr. Bartrow is certainly
anything but illiterate."</p>

<p>"No, he isn't that, though he has no education of
the kind you effete people have in mind when you
spell the word with a capital&mdash;the kind with a
Greek-letter-badge and college-yell attachment. If
you should tell him you had been to Bryn Mawr, he
would probably take it to be some summer resort he
hadn't heard of. But that isn't saying he is stupid.
He could give the man with the yell a lot of information
on a good many subjects. Poppa says he
was always an earnest little lad; always reading
everything he could get hold of&mdash;which wasn't
very much in the early days, as you may imagine."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, he seems to be getting on in the
world," said Miss Van Vetter. "Your father says
the Little Myriad is a promising mine."</p>

<p>There was more pathos than mirth in the smile
which flitted across Connie's face.</p>

<p>"You're new among us yet, Myra. Everything
with mineral in it is promising to us; we are cranks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
pure and simple, on that subject. The Little Myriad
is promising, of course,&mdash;there isn't an unpromising
mine in the State, for that matter,&mdash;but it's
only a promise, as yet. If Dick should reach the
end of his hundred and fifty feet of development
without striking pay, he would be a ruined man."</p>

<p>"Why couldn't he keep on until he should
strike it?"</p>

<p>"For the very simple reason that he is working
on borrowed capital; and I happen to know that he
has borrowed about all he can."</p>

<p>"But he believes in the success of the venture,
absolutely."</p>

<p>"Of course he does; that is one of the conditions.
It's merely a question of credit with him. If any
one would lend, Dick would go on borrowing and
digging until he struck pay-ore or came out on the
other side of the mountain&mdash;and then he'd think
he hadn't gone deep enough. That is the pathetic
side of his character; he never knows when he's
beaten."</p>

<p>"I should call it the heroic side."</p>

<p>"It is heroic, but it is pathetic, too. It is sure
to bring him trouble, sooner or later, and Dick isn't
one to take trouble lightly. He'll go on fighting
and struggling long after the battle has become
hopeless, and that makes the sting of defeat so much
sharper. It makes me want to cry when I think
what a terrible thing it would be for him if the Little
Myriad should go back on its promise."</p>

<p>Miss Van Vetter took the field-glass and stood up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
to watch the storm cloud which was now spreading
gradually and creeping slowly down the slopes of
the divide. "You think a great deal of Mr. Bartrow,
don't you, Connie?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I do; he comes next to poppa with me."</p>

<p>For so long a time as one might take in saying
a little prayer at a needful crisis, Myra gave her
undivided attention to the fleecy blur slipping down
the side of the main range. Then the strain on her
eyes filled them with tears, and she put the glass
back into its case. Constance saw the tears.</p>

<p>"Why, Myra! you're crying. What is the
matter?"</p>

<p>"I'm lonesome and homesick, and I long for the
flesh-pots of Denver; but it was the glass that made
me cry. Connie, dear, don't you think we'd better
be going back to town?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes; if you are quite ready. But it
will be a disappointment for Dick. He is counting
on another week, at least."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know; and that is why I think we ought
to go. We are keeping him from his work in the
mine, and his time is precious."</p>

<p>"Rather more so than he gives us to understand,
I fancy," Constance assented. "I suppose you are
right, Myra,&mdash;we ought not to stay; but you'll
have to tax your ingenuity to find an excuse that
will hold water. Dick won't be satisfied with a
P. P. C. card."</p>

<p>"Perhaps the chapter of accidents will help us.
If it doesn't, you must make your father remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
that he has urgent business in Denver which won't
wait. Can't you manage it that way?"</p>

<p>"If I can't, I'll ring you in. Poppa would take
passage for Honolulu to-morrow if he had an idea
that you'd like to see the Kanakas ride surf-boards."</p>

<p>"I should much rather not appear in it," said
Myra; and then, with truly feminine inconsistency,
"I don't know why I say that. On the whole, perhaps
you'd better say that it's my proposal. Then
Mr. Bartrow will set it down to the vagaries of a
flighty migrant, and he won't hold spite against his
old friends."</p>

<p>Connie the wise began to wonder if there were
unplumbed depths in her cousin,&mdash;depths which
Bartrow's defenseless obviousness had stirred to his
sparing; but she drove the thought out as unworthy.
Myra had been kind to Dick, certainly, but she had
never encouraged him. There might well be an accepted
lover in the dim Philadelphia background for
aught Myra had said or done to evince the contrary.
In which case&mdash;Connie the wise became Connie the
pitiful in the turning of a leaf&mdash;poor Dick! At
that moment, as if the sympathetic thought had
evoked him, Bartrow came in sight on the lower
slope of the summit. He was breathing hard when
he reached them.</p>

<p>"We can make it all right," he said, slinging the
glass and the haversack, "but it'll add three or four
miles. It's a roundabout way, and it will take us
into the head of Little Myriad Gulch. If you're
ready we'll get a quick move. That storm is heading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
straight for us, and we'll be in luck if we don't
come in for a soaking."</p>

<p>El Reposo is a bald mountain, and its tonsure is
fringed with a heavy forest growth which stops
abruptly at timber-line. Halfway to the head of
the gulch the new trail ended in a tangle of fallen
trees,&mdash;the débris of an ancient snowslide,&mdash;and
much valuable time was lost in skirting the obstacle.
Bartrow glanced over his shoulder from time to
time, and finally said, "There it comes, with a
vengeance!"</p>

<p>The exclamation was ill-timed. Myra turned and
stopped to watch the fleecy curtain of vapor shrouding
the great bald summit they had just quitted.
Bartrow sought to possess his soul in patience.</p>

<p>"Isn't it grand!" she said, with kindling enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Yes; grand and wet. If you'll excuse me,
Miss Myra, I think we'd better run for it."</p>

<p>They ran for it accordingly, Connie in the lead
like the free-limbed daughter of the altitudes that
she was, and Bartrow and Miss Van Vetter hand
in hand like joyous children for whom self-consciousness
is not. From the beginning of the wild race
down the slopes the wetting seemed momentarily
imminent; none the less, they managed to reach
the gulch dryshod. Inasmuch as their course down
the ravine was in a direction nearly opposite to the
sweep of the wind, it soon took them beyond the
storm zone, and they stopped to listen to the echoes
of nature's battle reverberating from the crags of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
higher levels. The writhing of the great firs in
the grasp of the wind came to their ears like the
clashing of miniature breakers on a tideless shore;
and the booming of the thunder was minified by the
rare atmosphere into a sound not unlike the distant
firing of cannon. While they paused, Myra climbed
to the top of a water-worn boulder in the bed of the
ravine to get a better point of view, and from this
elevation she could see the forest at the head of the
gulch.</p>

<p>"Oh, Connie!" she cried, "climb up here, quick!
It's a cyclone!"</p>

<p>Bartrow threw up his head like a startled animal.
There was a steady roar in the air which was not
of the thunder.</p>

<p>"Cyclone nothing!" he yelled. "It's a cloud-burst!
Stay where you are, for your life, Miss
Myra!"</p>

<p>Even as he spoke the roar deepened until the
vibration of it shook the solid earth, and a dark
mass of water, turbid and débris-laden, shot from
the head of the gulch and swept down the ravine.
Bartrow lived an anguished lifetime in an instant
of hesitation. To save the woman he loved was to
sacrifice Constance. To help Connie first was to
take the desperate chance that Myra would be safe
till he could reach her.</p>

<p>There was no time for the nice weighing of
possibilities; and Richard Bartrow was a man of
action before all else. Winding an arm about
Constance, he dashed out of the ravine with her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
getting back to Myra three seconds in advance of
the boulder-laden flood. There was time enough,
but none to spare. A tree gave him an anchorage
on the bank above her; she sprang toward him at
the word of command; and he plucked her up out
of the reach of the foaming torrent which snapped
at her and overturned the great rock upon which she
had been standing.</p>

<p>After which narrow escape they sat together on
the slope of safety and watched the subsiding flood,
laughing over the "stampede," as Connie called it,
with all the reckless hardihood of youth and good
spirits.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't have missed seeing it for anything in
the world," declared the enthusiast. "I had plenty
of time to get out of the way, but I couldn't help
waiting to see how it would look, coming over that
last cliff up there."</p>

<p>"Dick didn't give me a chance to see anything,"
Connie complained. "He whisked me out of the
way as if I'd been a naughty little girl caught playing
with the fire."</p>

<p>Bartrow examined the field-glass to see if it had
suffered in the scramble. It was unbroken, and he
put it back into the case with a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"If you two had smashed that glass between you,
I don't know what I should have done," he said;
whereat they all laughed again and took up the line
of march for the mine.</p>

<p>That evening, after supper, the four of them were
on the porch of the three-roomed cabin, enjoying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
the sunset. Constance had spoken to her father
about the return to Denver, and Stephen Elliott was
racking his brain for some excuse reasonable enough
to satisfy Bartrow, when a man came up the trail
from the direction of Alta Vista. It was Bryant,
the station agent; and he was the bearer of a
telegram addressed to Constance. She read it and
gave it to Bartrow. The operator had taken it
literally, and it was a small study in phonetics.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Shees gaun an got inter trubbel. P. Grims
swipt her masheen. Wot shel I do.</p>

<div class='sig'>
"<span class="smcap">T. Reagan.</span>"<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>Bartrow smiled and handed the message back.
"That's Tommie, I take it. What's it about?"</p>

<p>"It's a young woman I've been trying to help.
They are persecuting her again, and I'll have to go
back as quickly as I can."</p>

<p>"That's bad," said Bartrow; but Connie's father
looked greatly relieved, and, filling his pipe, began
to burn incense to the kindly god of chance.</p>

<p>After a time, Bartrow asked, "When?"</p>

<p>Connie's gaze was on the sunset, but her thoughts
were miles away in a humble cottage in West
Denver where she had thought Margaret would be
safely hidden from the spoiler.</p>

<p>"I think we'd better go now&mdash;to-night. You
can flag the train at the mine switch, can't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you can get ready, can't you, Myra?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly; it won't take me long to pack. If
you'll excuse me I'll go and do it now, and get it
off my mind."</p>

<p>When Myra had gone in, Bartrow took the message
and read it again. "This is no woman's job,"
he objected. "Let me go down with you and
straighten it out."</p>

<p>"No, you mustn't, Dick; you have lost a clear
week as it is."</p>

<p>She rose and went to the end of the porch,
whither he presently followed her. "You'll need a
man," he insisted.</p>

<p>"I shall have poppa."</p>

<p>"Yes, but he's no good&mdash;only to pay the
bills."</p>

<p>"No matter; I shall get along all right."</p>

<p>"That's straight, is it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I mean it."</p>

<p>"All right; you're the doctor. But you must
wire me if you need me."</p>

<p>An hour later the visitors had said good-by to
Bartrow and the Little Myriad, and were on their
way down the canyon in the miniature sleeping-car.
Myra pleaded weariness and had her berth made
down early. Nevertheless, she lay awake far into
the night gazing out at the rotating heavens and
the silent procession of peaks and precipices. For
a background the shifting scene held two irrelevant
pictures; one, freshly etched, reproducing the little
drama of the cloud-burst; the other a memory of
something she had read,&mdash;a story in which a man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
two women, an overturned boat, and a storm-lashed
lake figured as the persons and properties.</p>

<p>"He knew which he loved&mdash;which to save first&mdash;when
the crux came," she said softly to her
pillow, "and the other girl was fortunate not to
have drowned." And at that moment a certain
well-to-do gentleman of middle age in a far-away city
on the Atlantic seaboard was nearer the goal of his
wishes than he had ever been before.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Bartrow had an inspiration
which was importunate enough to send him afoot to
Alta Vista in the wake of the swinging passenger
train. It found voice in a mandatory telegram to
Lansdale, telling him to call at once upon Miss
Constance Elliott, to present the message as his
credential, and to place himself at her service in
any required capacity, from man-at-arms to attorney-at-law.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> his westward sweep over the Titanic playground
of farther Colorado, the sun looks down into
a narrow valley through which tumbles a brawling
stream whose waters, snow-born within rifle-shot,
go to swell the canyoned flood of the Gunnison
River. Fir-clad mountains, sombre green to timber-line
and fallow dun or dazzling white above it,
according to the season, stand like a cordon of
mighty sentinels around and about; and the foot of
civilized man treading the sward of the park-like
valley must first have measured many weary miles
of the mountain wilderness.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding its apparent inaccessibility, and
its remoteness from any hoof-worn trail, the valley
had once been inhabited. The evidences were a
rude log cabin, with its slab door hanging by a
single leathern hinge, buttressing a weathered cliff
on the western bank of the stream; and, in the
opposing mountain slope, a timbered opening
bearded with a gray dump of débris, marking the
entrance to a prospect tunnel.</p>

<p>Cabin and tunnel were both the handiwork of
James Garvin. On one of his many prospecting
tours he had penetrated to the shut-in valley; and
finding a promise of mineral deposits in the slopes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
of the sentinel mountains, had gone into permanent
camp and driven the prospect tunnel into the rocky
hillside. When he had done something more than
the development work necessary to hold the claim,
two things conspired to drive him forth of the valley.
His provisions ran low; and the indications in the
tunnel, which had pointed to a silver-bearing lode of
graphic tellurium, changed suddenly at a "dike" in
the strata, and disappeared altogether.</p>

<p>Garvin was a stubborn man, and the toxin of the
prospector's fever was in his blood. Wherefore he
put himself upon siege rations and delved against
time. When he had baked his last skillet of panbread
and fired his last charge of dynamite in the
heading, the dike was still unpenetrated. After
that, there was nothing for it but retreat; and he
reluctantly broke camp and left the valley, meaning
to return when he could.</p>

<p>Two years elapsed and the opportunity still tarried;
but Garvin kept the shut-in valley in mind,
and it was thitherward he turned his face when
Stephen Elliott's liberal "grub-stake," and the
hastily formed partnership with Jeffard, provided
the means and the help necessary to sink a shaft.</p>

<p>It was in the afternoon of a cloudless August
day that Jeffard had his first glimpse of the park-like
valley lying in the lap of the sentinel mountains.
The air was crisp and thin-edged with the
keen breath of the altitudes, but the untempered
heat of the sun beat pitilessly upon the heads of
the two men picking their laborious way over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
rock-ribbed shoulder of the least precipitous mountain.</p>

<p>"Well, pardner, we've riz the last o' the hills,"
quoth Garvin, stepping aside to let the burro, with
its jangling burden of camp utensils and provisions,
precede him. "How d'you stack up by this time?"</p>

<p>Jeffard's tongue clave to the roof of his mouth.
Frantic plunges into the nether depths are not conducive
to good health, moral or physical, and nature
was exacting the inevitable penalty. For three days
he had been fighting a losing battle with an augmenting
army of ills, and but for the rough heartening
of his companion he would have fallen by the wayside
more than once during the breath-cutting march
over the mountain passes. Wherefore his answer to
Garvin's question was the babblement of despair.</p>

<p>"I'm a dead man, Garvin. You'll only have
me to bury if you persist in dragging me any farther.
I'm done, I tell you."</p>

<p>Garvin stroked his stubbly chin and hid his concern
under a ferocious scowl.</p>

<p>"No, you ain't done, not by a long shot. You
needn't to think I'm goin' to let you play off on me
that-a-way&mdash;with the promised land cuddlin' down
yonder in that gulch a-waitin' for us. Not much,
Mary Ann. You're goin' to twist the crank o'
that there win'lass a-many a time afore you get
shut o' me."</p>

<p>The burro wagged one ear and sat upon its
haunches preparatory to a perilous slide down a
steep place in the trail. Garvin saved the pack by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
darting forward and anchoring both beast and burden
by main strength. While the big man was
wrestling with the burro, Jeffard stumbled and fell,
rose wavering to his knees and fell again, this time
with his teeth set to stifle a groan. Garvin threw
the pack-animal with dexterous twitch of its foreleg,
and hoppled it with a turn of the lariat before going
back to Jeffard.</p>

<p>"Now then, up you come," he said, trying to
stand Jeffard upon his feet; but the sick man collapsed
inertly and sank down again.</p>

<p>"Let me alone," he enjoined, in a sudden transport
of feeble truculence. "I told you I was done,
and I am. Can't you go about your business and
leave a man to die in peace?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you be damned," retorted Garvin cheerfully.
"All you need is a little more sand. Get up
and mog along now, 'fore I run shy o' patience and
thump the everlastin' daylights out o' you." And
he stooped again and slipped his arm under Jeffard's
shoulders.</p>

<p>The sick man's head rocked from side to side.
"Don't," he groaned, this time in gentler protest.
"I'd do it if I could&mdash;if only for your sake. But
it isn't in me; I've been dying on my feet for the
last three hours. I couldn't drag myself another
step if the gates of Heaven stood open down yonder
and all hell were yapping at my heels. Go on
and leave me to fight it out. You can come back
to-morrow and cover up what the buzzards have
left."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>Garvin straightened up and drew the back of his
hand across his eyes.</p>

<p>"Listen at him!" he broke out, in a fine frenzy
of simulated rage. "Just listen at the fool idjit
talk, will you? And me standin' over him a-pleadin'
like a suckin' dove! By crucifer! if it wasn't
for throwin' away good ammynition, I'd plug him
one just for his impidence&mdash;blame my skin if I
wouldn't!" And being frugal of his cartridges,
Garvin flung himself upon the prostrate burro,
dragged it to its feet, cast the jangling burden,
pack-saddle and all, and lifted Jeffard astride of the
diminutive mount.</p>

<p>"There you are," he said, with gruff tenderness.
"Now then, just lop your head on my shoulder
and lay back ag'inst my arm, and play you was
a-coastin' down the hill back o' the old schoolhouse
on a greazed streak o' lightnin', with your big
brother a-holdin' you on. We'll make it pretty
middlin' quick, now, if the canary don't peg out."
And thus they made entrance into the shut-in
valley, and won across it to the log cabin whose
door hung slantwise by the single hinge.</p>

<p>Then and there began a grim fight for the life of
a man, with an untutored son of the solitudes, lacking
everything but the will to do, pitted against a
fierce attack of mountain fever which was aided and
abetted by the devitalizing effects of Jeffard's hard
apprenticeship to evil. In the end the indomitable
will of the nurse, rather than any conscious effort
on the part of the patient, won the battle. Garvin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
cursed his luck and swore pathetically as day after
day of the short mountain summer came and went
unmarked by any pick-blow on the slopes of the
mountains of promise; but his care of the sick man
was unremitting, and he was brutally tender and
wrathfully soft-hearted by turns until Jeffard was
well beyond the danger line.</p>

<p>It was a lambent evening in the final week of
August when Garvin carried the fever-wasted convalescent
to the door of the cabin and propped him
in a rustic chair builded for the occasion.</p>

<p>"How's that?" he demanded, standing back to
get the general effect of man and chair. "Ain't I
a jack-leg carpenter, all right? Now you just brace
up and swaller all the outdoors you can hold while
I smoke me a pipe."</p>

<p>He sat down on the doorstep and filled and
lighted his pipe. After a few deep-drawn whiffs, he
said, "Don't tire you none to be a-settin' up, does
it?"</p>

<p>"No." Jeffard turned slowly and sniffed the
pungent fragrance of the burning tobacco with a
vague return of the old craving. "Have you another
pipe?" he queried. "I believe I'd enjoy a
whiff or two with you."</p>

<p>"Now just listen at that, will you?" Garvin
growled, masking his joy under a transparent affectation
of disgust. "Me takin' care of him like he
was a new-borned baby, and him a-settin' there, cool
as a blizzard, askin' for a pipe! If I wasn't a
bloomin' angel, just waitin' for my wings to sprout,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
I'd tell him to go to blazes, that's about what I'd
do."</p>

<p>None the less, he went in and found a clean corncob,
filling it and giving it to Jeffard with a lighted
match. The convalescent smoked tentatively for a
few minutes, pausing longer between the whiffs until
the fire and the tobacco-hunger died out together.
After which he said what was in his mind.</p>

<p>"Garvin, old man, you must begin work to-morrow,"
he began. "I can take care of myself now,
and in a few days I hope I'll be able to take hold
with you. You've lost too much time tinkering
with me. I'm not worth it."</p>

<p>"We'll find out about that when we get you
on to the crank o' that win'lass," said Garvin sententiously.
"Man's a good deal like a horse,&mdash;vallyble
accordin' to location. They tell me that back in
God's country, where I was raised, horses ain't worth
their winter keep since the 'lectric cars come in; but
out yere I've seen the time when a no-account,
gristly little bronco, three parts wire and five parts
pure cussedness, 'u'd a-been worth his weight in
bullion."</p>

<p>Jeffard picked the application out of the parable,
and smiled.</p>

<p>"You've got your bronco," he asserted. "When
you're a little better acquainted with me you'll find
your definition isn't far wrong. I used to think I
was a halfway decent sort of fellow, Garvin, but I
believe the last few months have flailed all the whole
wheat out of me, leaving nothing but the musty
chaff."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, you be hanged!" laughed Garvin, with the
emphasis heartening. "You're off your feed a few
lines yet and your blood needs thickenin', that's all.
I'll risk but what you'll assay up to grade in the
mill-run."</p>

<p>Silence came and sat between them for a little
space, holding its own until Jeffard's eye lighted
upon the débris-bearded tunnel-opening in the opposite
hillside.</p>

<p>"What is that?" he asked, pointing the query
with an emaciated finger.</p>

<p>"That's my old back number that I was tellin'
you about on the way in," Garvin explained. "I
thought I'd struck a lead o' tellurides up there, sure,
but it petered out on me."</p>

<p>"When was that?" Jeffard's recollection of all
things connected with the fever-haunted jornada
across the ranges was misty and fragmentary.</p>

<p>"Two year ago this summer," rejoined the miner;
and filling his pipe afresh he retold the story of his
earlier visit to the valley.</p>

<p>"It's a dead horse," he added, by way of conclusion.
"I ought to knowed better. I'm old
enough at the business to savvy tellurides when I
see 'em, and that lead never did look right from the
start."</p>

<p>"Did you ever locate it?" asked Jeffard.</p>

<p>"Not much! I never got any furder along that-a-way
than to stake it off and make a map of it."
Garvin found a pack of thumbed and grimy papers
in his pocket and worked his way through it till he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
came upon the map. "You're an engineer," he
said: "how's that for a jack-leg entry map?"</p>

<p>Jeffard examined the rude sketch and pronounced
it good enough; after which he folded the paper
absently and put it in his pocket. Garvin did not
notice his failure to return it,&mdash;if, indeed, he
thought or cared anything further about it,&mdash;and
went on talking of his own unwisdom in driving a
tunnel on a lode which did not "look right."</p>

<p>"We'll know better, this trip," he asserted, as
somewhat of a salve to the former hurt. "We'll
go higher up the gulch and sink a shaft; that's
about what we'll do."</p>

<p>And this, in the fullness of time, was what they
did. After a few days, Jeffard was able to inch his
way by easy stages to the new location; and by the
time Garvin had dug and blasted himself into a
square pit windlass-deep, the convalescent was strong
enough to take his place at the hoist.</p>

<p>From the very first, Jeffard was totally unable to
share Garvin's enthusiastic faith in the possibilities
of the new cast for fortune. Ignorant of the first
principles of practical metal-digging, he was, none
the less, a fairly good laboratory metallurgist; while
Garvin, on the other hand, knew naught of man's,
but much of nature's, book. Hence there arose
many discussions over the possibilities; Jeffard contending
that the silver-bearing lodes of the valley
were not rich enough to bear pack-train transportation
to the nearest railway point; and Garvin clinging
tenaciously to the prospectors' theory that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
"true-fissure" vein must of necessity prove a very
Golconda once you had gone deep enough into its
storehouse.</p>

<p>When all was said, the man of the laboratory
won a barren victory. At thirty feet the lode in
the shaft had dwindled to a few knife-blade seams,
and the last shot fired in the bottom of the excavation
put an end to the work of exploitation by letting in
a flood of water. Since they had no means of draining
the shaft so suddenly transformed into a well,
Garvin gave over, perforce, but proposed trying
their luck elsewhere in the valley before seeking a
new field. Jeffard acquiesced, with the suggestion
that they save time by prospecting in different
directions; and this they did, Garvin taking the
upper half of the valley and Jeffard the lower. At
the end of a week, Jeffard gave up in disgust;
and when his companion begged for yet one other
day, was minded to stay in camp and invite his soul
in idleness until the persevering one should be
convinced.</p>

<p>As a matter of course, Garvin's day multiplied
itself by three, and Jeffard wore out the interval as
best he might, tramping the hillsides in the vicinity
of the cabin to kill time, and smoking uncounted
pipes on the doorstep in the cool of the day while
waiting for Garvin's return.</p>

<p>It was in the pipe-smoking interregnum of the
third day that the abandoned tunnel in the opposite
hillside beckoned to him. Oddly enough, he thought,
Garvin had never referred to it since the retelling of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
its history in the reminiscent pauses of their first
outdoor evening together. Jeffard's eye measured
the dump appraisively. It was a monument to the
heroic perseverance of the solitary prospector.</p>

<p>"That hole must be thirty or forty feet into the
hill," he mused. "And to think of his worrying it
out alone!" Here idle curiosity nudged him with
its blunt elbow, and he rose and knocked the ashes
from his pipe. "I believe I'll go up and have a
look at it. It'll kill another half-hour or so, and
they're beginning to die rather hard."</p>

<p>He crossed the stream on Garvin's ancient foot-log,
and clambered leisurely to the toe of the dump.
The snows of two winters had washed the detritus
free of soil, and Jeffard bent, hand on knee, to look
for specimens of the ore-bearing rock.</p>

<p>"Gangue-rock, most of it, with a sprinkling of
decomposed quartz along at the last," he said reflectively.
"The quartz was the dike he struck, I
suppose. He was wise to give it up. There's no
silver in that stuff."</p>

<p>He picked up a bit of the snuff-colored rock and
crumbled it in his hand. It was quite friable, like
weathered sandstone, but when the fragment was
crushed the particles still clung together as if matted
with invisible threads. Jeffard was too new to
the business of metal-hunting to suspect the tremendous
significance of the small phenomenon, but he
was sufficiently curious to gather a double handful
of the fragments of quartz, meaning to ask Garvin
if he had noticed the peculiarity. And when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
had climbed to the tunnel and explored it to its
rock-littered heading by the light of a sliver splintered
from one of the pitchy logs of the timbering,
he sauntered back to the cabin beneath the western
cliff and made a fire over which to prepare supper
against Garvin's return.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Garvin</span> came into camp late, and Jeffard needed
not to ask the result of the day's quest. He
had cooked the simple supper, and they ate it
together in silence&mdash;the big man too weary and
dejected to talk, and Jeffard holding his peace in
deference to Garvin's mood. Over the pipes on the
doorstep Jeffard permitted himself a single query.</p>

<p>"No go?"</p>

<p>"Nary," was the laconic rejoinder.</p>

<p>Jeffard was the least demonstrative of men, but
the occasion seemed to ask for something more than
sympathetic silence. So he said: "It's hard luck;
harder for you than for me, I imagine. Somehow,
I haven't been able to catch the inspiration of the
mineral-hunt; but you have, and you've worked
hard and earned a better send-off."</p>

<p>"Huh! far as earnin' goes, I reckon it's a
stand-off 'twixt the two of us. You've certain'y
done your share o' the pullin' and haulin', if you
have been sort o' like what the boys call a 'hoodoo.'"</p>

<p>Jeffard blew a cloud of smoke toward the gray
rock-beard hanging ghostly beneath the black mouth
of the excavation in the opposite hillside, and was
far from taking offense. "Meaning that I haven't
been enthusiastic enough to fill the bill?" he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>"I guess that's about it. And it always seemed
sort o' cur'ous to me. Money'd do you a mighty
sight more good than it would me."</p>

<p>Jeffard smoked his pipe out, debating with himself
whether it was worth while to try to explain his
indifference to his companion. He did try, finally,
though more for the sake of putting the fact into
words than in any hope of making it understandable
to Garvin.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it isn't in me to care very much
about anything," he said, at the end of the reflective
excursion. "Six months ago I could have
come out here with you and given you points on
enthusiasm; but since then I've lived two or three
lifetimes. I'm a very old man, Garvin. One day,
not so very long ago, if you measure by weeks and
months, I was young and strong and hopeful, like
other men; but instead of burning the candle decently
at the proper end, I made a bonfire of it.
The fire has gone out now, and I haven't any other
candle."</p>

<p>The big prospector was good-naturedly incredulous.
"You've had the fever, and you're rattled,
yet; that's all that's the matter with you. You've
been flat down on your luck, like one or two of the
rest of us; but that ain't any reason why you can't
get up ag'in, is it?"</p>

<p>Jeffard despaired of making it clear to any simple-hearted
son of the wilderness, but he must needs
try again.</p>

<p>"That is your view of the case, and it would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
that of others who knew the circumstances as well as
you do. But it doesn't fit the individual. David
said he would wash his hands in innocency, and
perhaps he could, and did&mdash;though I doubt it. I
can't. When you picked me up that night on the
shore of the pond, I'd been wandering around in
the bottomless pit and had lost my way. I knew
then I shouldn't find it again, and I haven't. I
seem to have strayed into a region somewhere beyond
the place where the actual brimstone chokes
you; but it's a barren desert where nothing seems
quite the same as it used to&mdash;where nothing is the
same, as a matter of fact. Do I make it plain?"</p>

<p>"You bet you don't," responded Garvin, out of
the depths of cheerful density. "You've been a
mile or two out o' my reach for the last half-hour 'r
so. Ther' ain't no use a-cryin' over spilt milk, is
what I say; and when I go kerflummix, why, I just
cuss a few lines and get up and mog along, same as
heretofore."</p>

<p>Jeffard laughed, but there was no mirth in him.</p>

<p>"I envy you; you are a lucky man to be able
to do it. I wish in my soul I could."</p>

<p>"What's the reason you can't?"</p>

<p>"That is precisely what I haven't been able to
make you understand. But the fact remains. The
Henry Jeffard my mother knew is dead and buried.
In his place has arisen a man who is acquainted
with evil, and is skeptical about most other things.
Garvin, if you knew me as well as I know myself,
you'd run me out of this valley with a gun before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
you slept. I owe you as heavy a debt of gratitude
as any one man ever owed another, and yet if your
welfare stood between the beginning and the end of
some devil's service in which I might be commissioned,
you wouldn't be safe to sleep in the same
cabin with me."</p>

<p>"Oh, you be damned," said the big man, relapsing
into a deeper depth of incredulity. "You've
got a devil 'r two, all right, maybe, but they're the
blue kind, and they'll soak out in the washin'.
Fact o' the matter is, our cussed luck in this yere
hole in the ground has struck in on you worse'n it
has on me. You'll be all right when we get some
place else and strike it rich."</p>

<p>Jeffard refilled his pipe and gave over trying to
define himself in set terms. When next he broke
silence it was to speak of the impending migration.</p>

<p>"I suppose we pull out in the morning?" he said.</p>

<p>"Might as well. We've played the string out
up yere. Besides, summer's gone, and a month of
fall, and the grub's runnin' shy."</p>

<p>"Where next?" inquired Jeffard.</p>

<p>"I dunno, hardly. 'Tain't worth while to strike
furder in, this late in the season. We've got to be
makin' tracks along back t'wards the valley afore
the snow comes, and that'll be pretty quick now.
What d' you say to tryin' some o' the gulches o' the
Mosquito?"</p>

<p>"Anywhere you say. I'm with you&mdash;if you
care to take me after what I've tried to tell you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
But you'd much better go alone. You had it right
a while ago; you have yoked yourself to a Jonah."</p>

<p>"Jonah nothin'!" growled the soft-hearted giant.
"Nex' time I set out to devil you, I'll drill a hole
aforehand and put in a pinch o' dannymite along
with the joke. Then when I tech it off, you'll
know."</p>

<p>The moon was riding high in the black arch of
the sky, and the gray dump on the opposite mountain
stood out in bold relief. Jeffard rose and
leaned against the doorpost.</p>

<p>"Garvin, you have never yet told me who staked
us for this trip," he said, broaching a subject which
had more than once asked for speech.</p>

<p>The miner laughed. "You never asked. It's
the same old man that staked me when I was yere
the first time."</p>

<p>"When you dug that hole up yonder in the hill?"</p>

<p>"Um&mdash;hm."</p>

<p>"Who is he?"</p>

<p>Garvin hesitated. "I had a fool notion I wouldn't
tell you till we'd struck somethin' worth while,"
he said finally. "If so be we've got to go back
with our fingers in our mouths, I put it up that
maybe you'd feel easier in your mind if you didn't
know. You're so cussed thin-skinned about some
things that a feller has to watch out for you continnyus."</p>

<p>Jeffard dug the kindly intention out of the upbraiding,
and forebore to press the question. After
all, what did it matter? Whatever befell, he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
under no obligations to any one save Garvin. And
in the itemizing of that debt, an obligation which
made him restive every time he thought of it, he
lost sight of the question he had intended asking
about the peculiarity of the snuff-colored rock in the
abandoned tunnel.</p>

<p>A little later, Garvin got up with a mighty yawn,
and said: "If we're goin' to get out o' here afore
noon to-morrer, I reckon we'd better be huntin' us
a little sleep."</p>

<p>"Turn in if you like; I'm not sleepy yet," said
Jeffard; and when Garvin was gone in, he fell to
pacing up and down before the cabin door with his
hands behind him and the cold pipe between his
teeth.</p>

<p>To what good end had he been preserved by
Garvin's interference on that night of despair two
months before? Had the reprieve opened up any
practicable way out of the cynical labyrinth into
which he had wandered? Had his immense obligation
to the prospector quickened any fibre of the
dead sense of human responsibility, or lighted any
fire of generous love for his kind?</p>

<p>He shook his head. To none of these questions
could he honestly append an affirmative. In the
desolate wreck he had made of his life no good
thing had survived save his love for Constance
Elliott. That, indeed, was hopeless on the side of
fruition; but he clung to it as the one clue of
promise, hoping, and yet not daring to hope, that it
might one day lead him out of the wilderness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
indifference. While he dwelt upon it, pacing back
and forth in the moonlight, he recalled his picture
of her standing in the dust-filtered afternoon sunlight,
with the dim corridor for a background.</p>

<p>"God keep you, my darling. I may not look
upon your face again, but the memory of your
loving kindness to one soul-sick castaway will live
while he lives."</p>

<p>He said it reverently, turning his face toward the
far-away city beyond the foot-hills; and there was
no subtle sense of divination to tell him that, at an
unmapped side-track on the farther slope of the
southernmost sentinel mountain, Bartrow was at that
moment handing Constance Elliott up the steps of a
diminutive sleeping-car which was presently to go
lurching and swaying on its way down the mountain
in the wake of a pygmy locomotive. Nor could he
know that, a few hours earlier, the far-seeing gray
eyes, out of whose depths he had once drawn courage
and inspiration and the will to do good, had rested
for a moment on the shut-in valley.</p>

<p>For the southward sentinel mountain was known
to the dwellers on its farther slopes as El Reposo.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Robert Lansdale</span>, literary starveling and doomed
victim of an incurable malady, was yet sufficiently
unchastened to read Bartrow's telegram with the
nerves of reluctance sharp set. For what he persuaded
himself were good and defensible reasons, he
had lived the life of an urban hermit in Denver,
arguing that a poverty-smitten crumb-gatherer with
one foot in the grave might properly refuse to be
other than an onlooker in any scene of the human
comedy.</p>

<p>The prompting was not altogether unselfish. In
common with other craftsmen of his guild, Lansdale
was blessed, or banned, with a moiety of the
seer's gift. For him, as for all who can discern the
masks and trappings and the sham stage-properties,
the world-comedy had become pitifully tragic; and
he was by nature compassionate and sympathetic.
Wherefore he spared himself the personal point of
view, cultivating an aloofness which his few friends
were prone to miscall cynicism and exclusiveness.</p>

<p>Lansdale knew Miss Elliott by repute, and he
shrewdly suspected that she knew all Bartrow could
tell her about a certain literary pretender who had
once been rude enough to send apologies to a hostess
who had not invited him. None the less Bartrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
was too good a friend to be ignored in the day of
his asking; and Lansdale presented himself at the
door of the house in Colfax Avenue at an unfashionably
early hour, meaning to begin by making the
tender of his services as nearly a matter of business
as might be.</p>

<p>It was Connie herself who met him at the door
and would hear no more than his name until he
was established in her father's easy-chair before the
cheerful fire in the library. Her welcome was hospitably
cordial; and Lansdale, who had fondly imagined
embarrassment to be one of the foibles most
deeply buried under the débris of the disillusioning
years, found himself struggling with an attack of
tongue-tied abashment which is like to be the penalty
exacted of any hermit who refuses to mix and
mingle with his kind.</p>

<p>"I came to see you at the request of a friend of
yours, and of mine, Miss Elliott," he began formally,
fumbling in his pocket for the telegram. "I have
a message from Mr. Richard Bartrow which&mdash;will&mdash;explain"&mdash;</p>

<p>The search and the sentence raveled out together
in the discovery that the telegram which was to have
been his introduction had been left on the writing-table
in his room. Connie saw consternation in his
face and made haste to help him.</p>

<p>"From Mr. Bartrow? We have just returned
from a visit to his mine up in Chaffee County. Did
he forget something that he wanted to tell us, at the
last moment?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>"Really, I&mdash;I can't say," stammered Lansdale,
to whom the loss of the telegram was the dragging
of the last anchor of equanimity. "It appears that
I was thoughtless enough to leave the telegram in
my room. Will you excuse me until I can go back
and fetch it?"</p>

<p>"Is it necessary?" Connie queried. "Can't
you tell me what he says?"</p>

<p>Lansdale pulled himself together and gave her
the gist of Bartrow's mandate. Miss Elliott's laugh
made him forget his embarrassment.</p>

<p>"That is just like Dick," she said. "He offered
to come down with us last night, but I wouldn't let
him. You know Mr. Bartrow quite well, do you
not?"</p>

<p>"Very well, indeed."</p>

<p>"Then you know how anxious he always is to
help his friends."</p>

<p>"No one has better cause to know; he is one of
the finest fellows in the world," Lansdale rejoined
warmly.</p>

<p>"Thank you, for Dick's sake," said Connie;
"now we shall get on nicely. But to go back a
little: a young woman whom I have been trying to
help is in some trouble, and Dick thought he might
be needed. It was out of the goodness of his heart.
I really don't need any help&mdash;at least, not more
than my father's check-book can answer for."</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure? You must remember that
I am Richard Bartrow's substitute, and make use of
me accordingly. May I know the circumstances?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>Constance related them, telling him Margaret
Gannon's story as only a sister of mercy could tell
it; without extenuation or censure, and also without
embarrassment. Lansdale listened absorbedly, with
the literary instinct dominant. It was Margaret
Gannon's story, but Constance Elliott was the heroine;
a heroine worthy the pen of a master craftsman,
he thought, while the creative part of him was
busy with the pulling and hauling and scene-shifting
which the discovery of a Heaven-born central figure
sets in motion. But in the midst of it the man got
the better of the craftsman. He foresaw with sudden
clarity of insight that Miss Elliott would presently
be of the inner circle of those out of whom
the most hardened votary of the pen cannot make
copy; those whose personality is sacred because it
is no longer a thing apart to be dispassionately
analyzed.</p>

<p>When she made an end, he sat looking at her so
intently and so long that she grew nervous. The
light in his eyes made her feel as if she were focused
under the object glass of a microscope. He saw the
enthusiasm die out of her face and give place to discomposure,
and made eager apologies.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Miss Elliott; I didn't mean to be
rude. But I have never looked upon your like before,&mdash;a
woman in whom the quality of mercy is not
strained; whose charity is compassionate enough to
reach out to the unfortunate of her own sex."</p>

<p>Connie was too simple-hearted to be self-conscious
under commendation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is because your opportunities have been
unkind, I fancy. A few years ago your criticism
would have been very just; but nowadays much of
the rescue work is done by women, as it should be."</p>

<p>"Much of the organized work, yes. But your own
story proves that it has not become individualized."</p>

<p>"That may well be the fault of the advocate in
Margaret's case," returned Connie, whose charity was
not circumscribed. "If any one of the many good
women I have tried to enlist in this young woman's
cause had been the one to discover her, I should
doubtless have the same story to tell, and quite possibly
with a better sequel. But now you understand
why I don't need help. Tommie&mdash;he's my newsboy
henchman, you know&mdash;has been here this
morning to make his report. It seems that when
Margaret was taken sick she was in debt to this man
Grim for costumes, or railway fare, or something,
and he has taken her sewing-machine to satisfy the
claim."</p>

<p>The hectic flush in Lansdale's thin cheek began
to define itself, with a little pulse throbbing in the
centre of it.</p>

<p>"He is an iniquitous scoundrel, and he ought to
be prosecuted," he declared. "Don't you see?&mdash;but
of course you don't; you are too charitable to suspect
his real object, which is to drive the young
woman back into the service of his master, the devil.
He had no more legal right to take her sewing-machine
than he would have to attach the tools of a
mechanic. Is there any law in Colorado?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>"Plenty of it," Connie rejoined; adding, with
unconscious sarcasm, "but I think it is chiefly
concerned with disputes about mining claims."</p>

<p>"Let us hope there is a statute or two over and
above, for the protection of ordinary mortals," said
Lansdale, rising and finding his hat. "I presume
you meant to buy Margaret another sewing-machine.
You mustn't encourage buccaneering in any such
way. Let me go and try my powers of persuasion
on Mr. Peter Grim."</p>

<p>But Connie was not unmindful of what Bartrow
had told them about Lansdale's ill health, and she
promptly disapproved.</p>

<p>"No, indeed, you mustn't, Mr. Lansdale; you
mustn't think of doing any such thing. You don't
know the man. He is a 'hold-over' desperado from
the stage-line days. Even Dick admits that he is
a person to be feared and avoided. And, besides,
you're not strong, you know."</p>

<p>Lansdale smiled down upon her from his gaunt
height, and his heart warmed to her in a way which
was not to be accounted for by the simple rule of
the humanities.</p>

<p>"Dick told you that, too, did he? I am sorry."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because it involves your sympathy, and sympathy
is much too precious to be wasted upon such
flotsam as I. But I am quite robust enough to see
justice done in this young woman's case. You must
promise me not to move in it until you hear from
me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>Connie promised and let him go. But in the
stronger light of the hall she saw how really ill he
looked, and was remorsefully repentant, after her
kind.</p>

<p>Lansdale left the house in Colfax Avenue with an
unanalyzed sense of levitation, which made him feel
as though he were walking upon air; but when he
had accounted for the phenomenon he came to earth
again with disheartening celerity. What had a man
in whose daily walk death was a visible presence to
do with the tumult of gladsome suggestion evoked
by a few words of sympathy from a compassionate
young woman with a winsome face and innocent
eyes? Nothing; clearly, nothing whatever. Lansdale
set his teeth upon the word, and drove the
suggestion forth with sudden bitterness. His part
in the little drama growing out of Miss Elliott's
deed of mercy was at best but that of a supernumerary.
When he should have made his entrance and
exit, he must go the way of other supernumeraries,
and be presently forgotten of the real actors.</p>

<p>So ran the wise conclusion; but the event leagued
itself with unwisdom, and the prudent forecasting
gave place to the apparent necessities. The preliminary
interview with Grim was wholly abortive.
The man of vice not only refused point blank to
make restitution, but evinced a readiness to take the
matter into the courts which was most disconcerting
to Margaret Gannon's moneyless advocate. Thereupon
ensued other visits to the house in Colfax
Avenue, and a growing and confidential intimacy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
with Constance, and the enlisting of Stephen Elliott
in the cause of justice, and many other things not
prefigured in Lansdale's itinerary.</p>

<p>And at the end of it all it was Stephen Elliott's
check-book, and not an appeal to the majesty of
the law, which rescued Margaret Gannon's sewing-machine;
and the man of vice pocketed the amount
of his extortionate claim, and gave a receipt in full
therefor, biding his time, and bidding an obsequious
Son of Ahriman&mdash;the same whom Jeffard had
smitten aforetime&mdash;keep an eye on Margaret Gannon
against the day when she should be sufficiently
unbefriended to warrant a recasting of the net.</p>

<p>And when these things had come to pass, Robert
Lansdale was of all men the most miserable. From
much dabbling in the trickling rill of fictional sentiment,
he had come to disbelieve the existence of
any deep river of passion; but now he found himself
upon the brink of such a river and was forbidden
to plunge therein. Nay, more; he must turn
away from it, parched and thirsty as any wayworn
pilgrim of the world-desert, without so much as lifting
a palmful of its healing waters to his lips.</p>

<p>He postponed the turning away from day to day,
weakly promising himself that each visit to the house
in Colfax Avenue should be the last, and as weakly
yielding when a day or two of abstinence had enhanced
his soul-hunger until it became a restless
agony, mocking his most strenuous effort to drown
it in a sea of work.</p>

<p>Failing himself utterly, he fell to watching Connie's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
face for some token of the hopelessness of his
passion, telling himself that he should find strength
to stay away when he should read his sentence in
the calm gray eyes. But Connie's eyes were as yet
no more than frankly sympathetic. And because
he was far from home, and seemingly friendless,
and fighting the last grim battle with an incurable
malady, she made him welcome and yet more welcome,
until finally, the optimistic insanity of the
consumptive came upon him, assuring him that he
should live and not die, and pointing him hopefully
down a dim vista of years,&mdash;a shining way wherein
they two might walk hand in hand till they should
come to the gate of the House Beautiful whose chatelaine
is Fame.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> line of retreat from the valley, called by
Jeffard "of dry bones," to the possible land of promise
in the Mosquito, lay through Leadville; not
the teeming, ebullient, pandemoniac mining-camp of
the early carbonate era, but its less crowded, less
effervescent, though no less strenuous successor of
the present.</p>

<p>On the march across the sky-pitched mountains
it had been agreed between them that there should
be one bivouac in the city of the bleak altitudes.
That is to say, Garvin proposed it, and Jeffard assented,
though not without a premonition that the
halt would be fatal to the proposed Mosquito sequel
to the campaign in the Saguache. He knew at least
one of Garvin's weaknesses, and that it was akin
to his own. There were the beast of burden and
the dispensable moiety of the camping outfit to sell,
and provision to buy; and Jeffard weighed his companion
in the balances of his own shortcomings. He
was well assured that he could not trust himself
with money in his hand in any such city of chanceful
opportunity as the great carbonate camp; and
arraigning Garvin at the bar of the same tribunal,
he judged him before the fact.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a measure of the apathetic indifference
which possessed Jeffard that the premonition gave
him scant concern. He marveled inwardly when
the fact of indifference defined itself. Aside from
any promptings of common human gratitude evolving
themselves into friendly solicitude for the man
who had twice saved his life,&mdash;promptings which
he found dead because he looked to find them dead,&mdash;there
was this: If his companion should stumble
and spill the scanty residue in the common purse
the wolf-pack of famine and distress would be at
their heels in a single sweep of the clock-hands. And
yet the fact remained.</p>

<p>Jeffard was cogitating vaguely this curious manifestation
of mental and moral inertia when the city
of the altitudes came into view over the crest of the
final ascent in the toilsome journey. The smoke
from the smelters was trailing lazily toward the distant
Mosquito, and a shifting cumulus of steam
marked the snail-like advance of a railway train up
the steep grade from Malta. California Gulch and
the older town were hidden behind the mountain of
approach; but the upper town and its western environs
lay stark in the hazeless atmosphere, with the
snow-splotched background of the nearer range, uptilted
and immense, dwarfing the houses into hutch-like
insignificance. Dreary as is this first view of
the Mecca of wealth-seekers, it has quickened the
pulse and brightened the eye of many a wayworn pilgrim
of the mountain desert; but Jeffard's thought
was in his question to Garvin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is it as near as it looks? or is it as far away as
this cursed no-atmosphere removes everything?"</p>

<p>"It's a good ten mile 'r so, yet. If we get a
move on, we'll make it by sundown, maybe."</p>

<p>They tramped on in silence, the singing silence of
the crystalline heights, measuring mile after mile at
the heels of the patient burro, and reaching the
scattering outposts of the western suburb while yet
the sun hung hesitant above the peaks of the main
range. The nearer aspect of the great mining-camp
was inexpressibly depressive to Jeffard. The weathered
buildings, frankly utilitarian and correspondingly
unbeautiful; the harsh sterility of the rocky
soil; the ruthless subordination of all things to the
sordid purposes of money-getting; these were the
stage-settings of a scene which moved him curiously,
like the fumes of a mingled cup, intoxicating, but
soul-nauseating, withal. The nausea was a consequent
of the changed point of view, and he knew it;
but it was no whit less grievous. Wherefore he
groped in the pool of indifference until he found a
small stone of protest.</p>

<p>"Let us do what we have to do and get away
from here quickly, Garvin," he said, flinging the
stone with what precision there was in him.</p>

<p>They had turned into the principal street, and the
burro became reluctant. Garvin smote the beast
from behind, and took a turn of the halter around
its jaw.</p>

<p>"Goin' to gig back for the crowd, ain't you?" he
growled, apostrophizing the jack; and then to Jeffard:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
"Makes you sort o' town-sick, I reckon. I
know the feel of it; used to catch it, reg'lar, ever'
time I'd get in from the range. It'll wear off
after a day 'r so; but, as you say, the quick way to
do it up is to light out ag'in, suddint."</p>

<p>"The sooner the better," said Jeffard. "The
atmosphere of the place is maddening."</p>

<p>Garvin took the word literally and laughed.
"'T ain't got no atmosphere to speak of,&mdash;that's
what's the matter with it; too blame' high up for
any use."</p>

<p>They were in the thick of the street traffic by this
time, and it required their united malisons joined to
what of energy and determination the long day's
march had left them to keep the ass from planting
itself monument-wise in the middle of the street.</p>

<p>"Dad burn a canary, anyhow!" grumbled the
man of the wilderness, when they were resting a
moment in front of a shackly building on the corner
of a cross street. "For ornerary, simon-pure, b'iled-down,
soul-killin'"&mdash;His vocabulary of objurgatory
expletives ran short, and he wrought out the
remainder of the malediction with a dumb show of
violence.</p>

<p>Jeffard smiled in spite of his mood, which was
anything but farcical, and pointed to the haversack
of specimens dangling from the loosened pack.</p>

<p>"We're about to lose the samples," he said.</p>

<p>Garvin regained his wonted good-humor at a
plunge.</p>

<p>"That'd be too blame' bad, wouldn't it, now;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
they're so blazin' precious! S'pose you lug 'em
acrost yonder to that there assay-shop whilst I toll
the canary down to the corral. When you get shut
o' the rocks, come on round to the boardin'-house,&mdash;'Miner's
Rest,'&mdash;a block furder along and two to
your right. I'll meet you there bime-by, if there's
anything left o' me after I get through with this
dad-burned, lop-eared totin'-machine."</p>

<p>Jeffard shouldered the bag of samples, but before
he could reply the opportunity fled clamorous. The
lop-eared one, finding itself free for the moment,
gave heed to a foolish bee buzzing in its atomic
brain, and went racing down the cross street, with
the big miner in hot pursuit.</p>

<p>"Exit James Garvin," quoth Jeffard, moved to
smile again; and he crossed the avenue to the
shackly building with the sign of the assayer besprent
upon the windows.</p>

<p>When he tried the door and found it locked, and
the littered room beyond it empty, he was minded to
go on to the rendezvous while daylight served. But
when he reflected that Garvin would be sure to
await an assayer's verdict on the samples, and so
prolong their stay in the city of banality, he decided
to conclude the business affair first. So he went up
and down and around and about, and found all the
assay offices closed for the day save one, whose occupant,
a round-bodied little German, with the face of
a cherub, martialized by the huge mustachios of a
cuirassier, was still at his bench. Jeffard guessed
at the little man's nationality, and made a shrewd
bid for celerity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Guten abend, mein Herr</i>," he said, unslinging
his haversack.</p>

<p>The cherubic face of the expatriated one responded
quickly to the greeting in the loved mother-tongue.</p>

<p>"<i>Wie geht's, wie geht's, mein guter Herr</i>," he rejoined;
and then in broken English: "I haf not
dot Cherman before heard spoken in dis Gott-forsaken
blaces. You haf some sambles <i>gebracht</i>?"</p>

<p>"<i>Ja, mein Herr.</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Gut!</i> I vill of dem de tests maig. <i>Nicht
wahr?</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Gefälligst, mein lieber Herr</i>;" and quickly,&mdash;"we
must go on our way again to-morrow."</p>

<p>"So qvick? <i>Ach! das ist nicht sehr gut.</i> You
vill der poor olt assay-meister maig to vork on der
nide. But because you haf der goot Cherman in
your moud I vill it do. Vat you haf?"</p>

<p>Jeffard unwrapped the samples one by one, and
the assayer examined them with many dubious head-shakings.
The amateur made haste to anticipate
the preliminary verdict.</p>

<p>"I know they're valueless," he admitted, "but
I have a partner who will require your certificate
before he will be convinced. Can you let us know
to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Because you haf der Cherman, yes. But it vill
be no goot; der silwer iss not dere"&mdash;including
the various specimens in a comprehensive gesture.</p>

<p>Jeffard turned to go, slinging the lightened haversack
over his shoulder. At the door he bethought
him of the curious fragment of quartz picked up on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the dump of the abandoned tunnel. It was in his
pocket, and he rummaged till he found it.</p>

<p>"Can you tell me anything about this?" he
asked. "It seems to be a decomposed quartzite,
matted on a base of some sort,&mdash;a metal, I should
say."</p>

<p>The little German snatched the bit of quartz, and
ogled it eagerly through his eye-glass.</p>

<p>"<i>Mein Gott im Himmel!</i>" he cried; and the eye-glass
fell to the floor and rolled under the bench.
"Iss it possible dot you know him not? Dot iss
golt, <i>mein lieber freund</i>,&mdash;vire golt, reech, reech!
Vere you got him? Haf you got some more <i>von</i>
dis?"</p>

<p>Jeffard took it in vaguely, and tried to remember
what he had done with the handful of similar fragments
gathered at the same time. It came to him
presently. He had emptied his pocket into the
haversack on the morning of the departure from the
valley what time Garvin was seeking the strayed
burro.</p>

<p>He unslung the canvas bag and poured the handful
of gravel on the bench. The assayer, trembling
now with repressed excitement, examined the snuff-colored
quartz, bit by bit, with a guttural ejaculation
for each. "<i>Donnerwetter!</i> He gifs me feerst der
vorthless stones to maig of dem de assay, und den
he vill ask me von leedle qvestion about dis&mdash;dis
maknificend bonansa! <i>Ach! mein freund!</i> haf
you got <i>viel</i> of dis precious qvartz?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes; there's a good bit of it, I believe,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
replied Jeffard, still unawake to the magnitude of
the discovery.</p>

<p>"Und you can find der blaces again? Dink
aboud it now&mdash;dink hardt!"</p>

<p>Jeffard smiled. "Don't get excited, <i>mein Herr</i>.
I know the place very well, indeed; I left it only
three days since."</p>

<p>"<i>Gut; sehr gut!</i> Now go you; go und leef me
to <i>mein</i> vork. Come you back in der <i>morgen</i>, und
I vill tell you dot you are reech, reech! Go, <i>mein
freund</i>, mit der goot Cherman in your moud&mdash;und
Gott go mit you."</p>

<p>Jeffard felt his way down the dark stair, and so
on out into the lighted street, still only in the middle
ground between realization and the bare knowledge
of the fact. He was conscious of some vague
recurrent effort to surround the incredible thing;
and conscious, too, that it grew and spread with
each succeeding attempt to measure it until no mere
human arms could girdle it.</p>

<p>Not yet did it occur to him to place himself at the
nodus of discovery and possession. The miraculous
thing was for him quite a thing apart; and when
he had advanced far enough into the open country
of realization to look a little about him, his thought
was wholly for Garvin and the effect upon him of
this sudden projection into the infinite. He tried
to imagine the simple-hearted prospector as a man
of affluence, and laughed aloud at the grotesque
figure conjured up by the thought. What would
Garvin do with his money? Squander it royally,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
like a loyal son of fortune, and think the world well
lost, Jeffard decided.</p>

<p>The hissing gasoline torch of a street fakir flared
gustily in the keen night wind sweeping down from
the Mosquito, and the scintillant arc-stars at the
corners began to take on frosty aureoles of prismatic
hues. The crowds on the resonant plank sidewalks
streamed boisterous and masterful, as if the plangent
spirit of time and place were abroad. Jeffard came
to earth again in the rude jostling of the throng.
While he speculated, Garvin&mdash;Garvin the inexpectant&mdash;was
doubtless awaiting him at the place
appointed. He must hasten thither to be the bearer
of the good news to the unspoiled one.</p>

<p>Looking about him to get his bearings, he found
himself in front of the deserted assay office on the
spot where he had parted from Garvin. "One
square down and two to the right," he said, repeating
Garvin's directions; and he set out to trudge
them doggedly, lagging a little from honest leg-weariness.
In the last half of the third square
there was a screened doorway, and the click of celluloid
counters came to his ears from the brilliantly
lighted room beyond. At the sound the embers of
the fire kindled months before glowed afresh and
made his heart hot.</p>

<p>"Ah, you're there yet, are you?" he said, speaking
to the stirring passion as if it were a sentient
entity within him. "Well, you'll have to lie down
again; there's no meat on the bone."</p>

<p>At the designated corner he found the rendezvous.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
It was a hostelry of the baser sort, with a bar-room
dominant, and eating and sleeping conveniences&mdash;or
inconveniences&mdash;subsidiary. The clatter of
knives and forks on ironstone china came from the
ill-smelling dining-room in the rear, and the bar-room
held but one occupant. It was Garvin; he
was sitting at one of the card-tables with his head in
his arms. He looked up when Jeffard entered, and
his smile was of fatigue.</p>

<p>"Hello, there; thought you'd gone and got lost
in the shuffle. Get shut of 'em?"</p>

<p>Jeffard nodded.</p>

<p>"No good, I reckon?"</p>

<p>"No; nothing that we've found this summer.
But you're a rich man, just the same, Garvin."</p>

<p>"Yes; I've cashed in on the outfit, and I've got
twenty dollars in my inside pocket. Let's go in and
chew before them fellers eat it all up."</p>

<p>"Don't be in a hurry; the kind of supper we'll
get here can wait. I said you are a rich man, and
I meant it. You remember the old hole up in the
hillside above the camp,&mdash;the one you struck a
'dike' in two years ago?"</p>

<p>"Reckon I ain't likely to forget it."</p>

<p>"Well, that 'dike' was decomposed quartz carrying
free gold. I was curious enough to put a handful
of the stuff into my pocket and bring it out.
The assayer's at work on it now, and he says it'll
run high&mdash;up into the hundreds, I imagine. Is
there much of it?"</p>

<p>The effect of the announcement on the unspoiled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
one was like that of an electric shock. He staggered
to his feet, went white under the bronze, and flung
his arms about Jeffard.</p>

<p>"Hooray!" he shouted; "that old hole&mdash;that
same derned old hole 'at I've cussed out more'n a
million times! Damn my fool soul, but I knew you
was a Mascot&mdash;knew it right from the jump! Come
on&mdash;let's irrigate it right now, 'fore it's a minute
older!"</p>

<p>It was out of the depth of pure good-fellowship
that Jeffard went to the bar with the fortune-daft
miner. Not all the vicissitudes of the breathless
rush down the inclined plane had been sufficient to
slay the epicure in him; and the untidy bar reeked
malodorous. But the occasion was its own excuse.</p>

<p>Garvin beat upon the bar with his fist, and the
roar of his summons drowned the clatter of knives
and forks in the adjacent dining-room. The bartender
came out, wiping his lips on the back of his
hand.</p>

<p>"What'll it be, gents?"</p>

<p>"The best you've got ain't good enough," said
Garvin, with unwitting sarcasm. "Trot her out&mdash;three
of a kind. It's on me, and the house is
in it."</p>

<p>The man spun two glasses across the bar, and set
out a black bottle of dubious aspect. Knowing his
own stock in trade, he drew himself a glass of Apollinaris
water.</p>

<p>Jeffard sniffed at the black bottle and christened
his glass sparingly. The bouquet of the liquor was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
an entire round of dissipation with the subsequent
headache thrown in. Garvin tilted the bottle with
trembling hand, and filled his glass to the brim.
The object-lesson was not thrown away upon the
epicure.</p>

<p>"Here's to the derned old hole with a cold million
in it," said the miner, naming the toast and
draining his glass in the same breath. And then:
"Come again, barkeep'; drink water yourself, if
you want to, but the red likker's good enough for
us. What do ye say, pardner? We're in it at last,
plum up to the neck, and all on account o' that
derned old hole 'at I've cussed out a mil&mdash; Here's
lookin' at ye."</p>

<p>Jeffard merely moistened his lips the second
time, and the object-lesson exemplified itself. Garvin
had brimmed his glass again, and the contents
of the black bottle were adulterant poisons. Wherefore
he cut in quickly when Garvin would have
ordered again.</p>

<p>"That'll do, old man; a little at a time and often,
if you must, but not on an empty stomach. Let's
get the money before we spend it."</p>

<p>The latter part of the warning had special significance
for the bartender, who scowled ominously.</p>

<p>"Lemme see the color o' yer money," he commanded.
"If youse fellies are runnin' futures on
me"&mdash;</p>

<p>Now Garvin had been living the life of an anchoret
for many weeks, and the fumes of the fiery liquor
were already mounting to his brain. For which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
cause the bartender's insinuation was as spark to
tow.</p>

<p>"Futures?" he yelled, throwing down a ten-dollar
bill with a mighty buffet on the bar; "them's the
kind o' futures we're drinkin' on right now! Why,
you thick-lipped, mealy-mouthed white nigger, you,
I'll come down here some day and buy the floor out
from in under your feet; see? Come on, pardner;
let's mog along out o' here 'fore I'm tempted to
mop up his greasy floor with this here"&mdash;</p>

<p>There was hot wrath in the bartender's eyes, and
Jeffard hustled the abusive one out of the place
lest a worse thing should follow. On the sidewalk
he remembered what Garvin had already forgotten,
and went back for the change out of the ten-dollar
bill, dropping it into his pocket and rejoining
his companion before the latter had missed him.
Thereupon ensued a war of words. The newly
belted knight of fortune was for making a night of
it; and when Jeffard would by no means consent to
this, Garvin insisted upon going to the best hotel in
the city, where they might live at large as prospective
millionaires should.</p>

<p>Jeffard accepted the alternative, and constituted
himself bearward in ordinary to the half-crazed son
of the wilderness. He saw difficulties ahead, and
the event proved that he did not overestimate them.
What a half-intoxicated man, bent upon becoming
wholly intoxicated, may do to make thorny the path
of a self-constituted guardian Garvin did that night.
At the hotel he scandalized the not too curious clerk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
and became the centre of an appreciative group in
the rotunda what time Jeffard was pleading the
mitigating circumstances with the hesitant deputy
proprietor. In the midst of the plea, when Jeffard
had consented to assume all responsibility for his
companion's vagaries, Garvin broke cover in the
direction of the bar-room, followed by a tail of
thirsty ones.</p>

<p>"You say you know him?" said the clerk tentatively.</p>

<p>"Know him? Why, yes; he is my partner.
We are just in from the range, and he has struck it
rich. It's a little too much for him just now, but
he'll quiet down after a bit. He is one of the best
fellows alive, when he's sober; and this is the first
time I've ever seen him in liquor. Two drinks of
bad whiskey did it."</p>

<p>"Two drinks and a surfeit of good luck," laughed
the clerk. "Well, we'll take him; but you must
keep him out of the way. He'll be crazy drunk in
less than an hour. Been to supper?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Better have it sent to your room. He isn't fit
to go to the dining-room."</p>

<p>"All right; have a bell-boy ready, and I'll knock
him down and drag him out, if I can."</p>

<p>That was easier said than done. Jeffard found
the foolish one in the bar-room, drinking <i>ad libitum</i>,
and holding forth to a circle of interested hearers.
Garvin had evidently been recounting the history of
the abandoned claim, and one of the listeners, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
hawk-faced man, with shifty black eyes, was endeavoring
to draw him aside. He succeeded just as
Jeffard thrust his way into the circle, and the self-elected
bearwarden caught the whispered question
and its answer.</p>

<p>"You say you located her two years ago?"
queried the hawk-faced one.</p>

<p>"No; that's the joke o' the whole shootin'-match,&mdash;thess
like I was a-tellin' ye." Garvin's
speech ran back to its native Tennessee idiom at
the bidding of intoxication. "She ain't nev' been
located <i>yit</i>; and if it hadn't 'a' been for that derned
little sharp-eyed pardner o' mine"&mdash;</p>

<p>The questioner turned quickly to the bar.</p>

<p>"Drinks all round, gentlemen&mdash;on me." Then
to Garvin in the cautious undertone: "You said
she was over in Stray Horse Valley, didn't you?"</p>

<p>Garvin fell into the trap headlong. "Not much
I didn't! She's a-snugglin' down under one o' the
bigges' peaks in the Saguache, right whar she can
listen to the purlin' o' the big creek that heads
in"&mdash;</p>

<p>There was no time for diplomatic interference.
Jeffard locked his arm about Garvin's head, and
dragged the big man bodily out of the circle.</p>

<p>"You fool!" he hissed. "Will you pitch it into
the hands of the first man that asks for it? Come
along out of this!"</p>

<p>Garvin stood dazed, and a murmur of disapproval
ran through the group of thirsters. The hand of
the hawk-faced one stole by imperceptible degrees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
toward his hip pocket. Jeffard stopped it with a
look.</p>

<p>"You have had fun enough with my partner for
one evening, gentlemen," he said sternly. "Come
on, Jim; let's go to supper."</p>

<p>And the thirsters saw them no more.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was midnight and worse before the lately belted
knight of fortune had outworn the hilarious and
entered upon the somnolent stage of the little journey
insensate, and when the thing could be done,
Jeffard put him to bed with a pæan of thanksgiving
which was none the less heartfelt for being unvocalized.</p>

<p>Having thus set his hand to Garvin's plough, there
was no alternative but to turn the furrow to the end;
wherefore, to guard against surprises, he hid the
boots of the bottle-mad one, barricaded the door with
his own bed, and lay down to doze with eyelids ajar.
At least that was the alert determination; but the
event proved that he was weary enough to sleep
soundly and late, and it was seven o'clock, and the
breakfast caller was hammering on the door, when
he opened his eyes on the new day. Naturally, his
first thought was for his companion, and the sight
of the empty bed in the farther corner of the room
brought him broad awake and afoot at the same
saltatory moment. The son of fortune was gone,
and an open door into the adjoining room accounted
for the manner of his going.</p>

<p>Five minutes later, picture an anxious brother-keeper
making pointed inquiries of the day-clerk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
below stairs. Instant question and answer fly back
and forth shuttle-wise, one may suppose, weaving
suspicion into a firm fabric of fact. Two men
whose names, or whose latest aliases, were Howard
and Lantermann, had occupied the room next
to Jeffard's,&mdash;quite chancefully, the clerk thinks.
They had left at an early hour; their call was for&mdash;one
moment, and he (the clerk) will ascertain the
exact time.</p>

<p>Whereupon one may fancy an exasperated bearwarden
cursing exactnesses and beating with impatient
fist upon the counter for the major fact.
The fact, extorted at length, is simple and conclusive.
The two men had come down some time
between five and six o'clock, with a third as a middle
link in a chain of locked arms. One of the two had
paid the bill, and they had all departed; by way of
the bar-room and the side entrance, as the clerk
remembers.</p>

<p>Whereat Jeffard is moved to swear strange oaths;
is swearing them, in point of fact, when the omnibus
from an early train shunts its cargo of arrivals into
the main entrance. Among the incomers is a big
fellow with a drooping mustache and square-set
shoulders, who forthwith drops his handbag and
pounces upon Jeffard with greetings boisterous.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be shot!&mdash;or words to that effect"
(hand-wringings and shoulder-clappings). "Now
where on top of God's green earth did you tumble
from? Begin away back yonder and give an account
of yourself; or, hold on,&mdash;let me write my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
name in the book and then you can tell me while we
eat. By Jove, old man! I'm foolishly glad to see
you!"</p>

<p>Jeffard cut in quickly between the large-hearted
protest and the signing of the register.</p>

<p>"Just a second, Bartrow; let the breakfast wait,
and listen to me. I'm in no end of a tangle, and
you're the man of all others to help me out if any
one can. Do you happen to know a fellow named
Garvin?"</p>

<p>"Don't I? 'Tennessee Jim, P. P.,'&mdash;that stands
for perennial prospector, you know. Sure. He's
of the salt of the earth; rock salt, but full flavored.
I know him like a book, though I hadn't seen him
for a dog's-age until&mdash;but go on."</p>

<p>Jeffard did go on, making the occasion one of the
few which seemed to justify the setting aside of
indirection.</p>

<p>"We were partners; we have been out together
all summer. He has struck it rich, and has gone
clean daft in the lilt of it. I can't get him sober
long enough to do what may be necessary to secure
the claim. The sharks are after him hot foot, and
if they can succeed in soaking the data out of him,
they will jump the claim before he can get it located
and recorded."</p>

<p>Bartrow laughed. "That's just like Jim: ordinarily,
he doesn't drink as much whiskey in a year
as most men do in a week. But if that's your only
grief you can come to breakfast with me and take
your time about it. Later on, when we've smoked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
a few lines and brought up the arrears of gossip,
we'll hold a council of war and see what you're to
do about the potential bonanza."</p>

<p>"But I can't do anything; it's Garvin's, I tell
you."</p>

<p>"Well, you are partners in it, aren't you?"</p>

<p>Jeffard had another fight with an ingrained reserve
which was always blocking the way to directness
and prompting him to leave the major fact unstated.</p>

<p>"We are not partners in this particular claim.
It's an old discovery of Garvin's. He drove the
tunnel on it two years ago and then abandoned it.
He was looking for tellurides and opened a vein
of free-gold quartz without knowing what he had
found."</p>

<p>"Then it's nobody's claim, as it stands; or
rather I should say it's anybody's. You&mdash;or
rather Garvin&mdash;will have to begin at the beginning,
just as if it were a new deal; go back and
post a notice on the ground and then come out and
record it. And if it's Garvin's claim, as you say,
he's got to do this in person. Nobody can do it for
him. You can't turn a wheel till you get hold of
Jim, and that's what makes me say what I 'does.'
Let's go in and eat."</p>

<p>"But, Dick; you don't understand"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, I do; and I happen to know a thing or
two about this deal that you don't. You've got the
whole forenoon before you; you are as safe as a
house up to twelve o'clock. Come on."</p>

<p>"I say you don't understand. You called it a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
'potential bonanza' just now, meaning that it
wouldn't make so very much difference if it were
never recorded. But it's a bonanza in fact. If
Rittenberger knows what he is talking about, it is
the biggest strike of the year, by long odds. I don't
know much about such things, but it seems to me it
ought to be secured at once and at all hazards."</p>

<p>"Rittenberger, you say?&mdash;the little Dutchman?
You can bank on what he tells you, every time. I
didn't know you'd been to an assayer. What is
the figure?"</p>

<p>"I don't know that. I left the sample with him
last night, and was to call this morning for the certificate.
But the little man bubbled over at the mere
sight of it."</p>

<p>"Good for old Jim! So much the better. Nevertheless,
as I say, you've an easy half-hour in which
to square yourself with me over the ham and eggs
and what-not, and plenty of time to do what there is
to be done afterward. You can't do anything but
wait."</p>

<p>"Yes, I can; I can find Garvin and make sure of
him. Don't you see"&mdash;</p>

<p>"I see that I'll have to tell you all I know&mdash;and
that's something you never do for anybody&mdash;before
you'll be reasonable. Listen, then: I saw your
chump of a partner less than an hour ago. He was
with two of his old cronies, and all three of them
were pretty well in the push, for this early in the
morning. They boarded the train I came up on,
and that is why I say you're safe till noon. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
is no train from the west till twelve-seven. I know
Jim pretty well, and at his foolishest he never quite
loses his grip. He had it in mind that he ought to
fight shy of something or somebody, and he's given
you the slip, dodged the enemy, and gone off on a
three-handed spree all in a bunch. There now, does
that clear up the mystery?"</p>

<p>Jeffard had caught at the counter-rail and was
gradually petrifying. Here was the worst that could
have befallen, and Bartrow had suspected nothing
more than a drunken man's frolic.</p>

<p>"Gone?&mdash;with two men, you say? Can you
describe them?"</p>

<p>"Roughly, yes; they were Jim's kind&mdash;miners
or prospectors. One of them was tall and thin and
black, and the other was rather thick-set and red.
The red one was the drunkest of the three."</p>

<p>"Dressed like miners?" Jeffard had to fight for
the "s's." His tongue was thick and his lips dry.</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>"That settles it, Dick, definitely. Last night
those two fellows were dressed like men about town
and wore diamonds. They've soaked their information
out of Garvin, and they are on their way to
locate that claim."</p>

<p>It was Bartrow's turn to gasp and stammer.
"What?&mdash;locate the&mdash;Cæsar's ghost, man, you're
daft! They wouldn't take Garvin with them!"</p>

<p>"They would do just that. In the first place,
with the most accurate description of the locality
that Garvin, drunk, could give them, there would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
the uncertainty of finding it without a guide. They
know that they have left a sane man behind them
who can find the way back to the claim; and their
only chance was to take Garvin along, keeping him
drunk enough to be unsuspicious, and not too drunk
to pilot them. Once on the ground ahead of me,
and with Garvin in their power, they can do the
worst."</p>

<p>Bartrow came alive to the probabilities in the
catching of a breath. "Which will be to kill Garvin
safely out of the way, post the claim, and snap
their fingers at the world. Good Lord!&mdash;and I
let 'em knock him down and drag him out under my
very eyes! I'd ought to be shot."</p>

<p>"It's not your fault, Dick; it's mine. I saw
what was in the wind last night, and stuck to Garvin
till I got him to bed. I was dog-tired,&mdash;we'd been
tramping all day,&mdash;and I thought he was safe to
sleep the clock around. I hid his boots, dragged
my bed across the door, and went to sleep."</p>

<p>"You couldn't have done less&mdash;or more. What
happened?"</p>

<p>"This. Those two fellows had the room next to
us, and there was a door between. They slipped him
out this morning before I was awake."</p>

<p>"Of course; all cut out and shaped up beforehand.
But, thank the Lord, there's a ghost of a
chance yet. Where is the claim?"</p>

<p>"It is three days' march a little to the south of
west, on the headwaters of a stream which flows into
the Gunnison River."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>"And the nearest railroad point?"</p>

<p>"Is Aspen. If I remember correctly, Garvin said
it was about twenty miles across the range."</p>

<p>"Good. That accounts for the beginning of the
race; they'll go to Aspen and take horses from
there. But I don't understand why they took the
long line. There are two railroads to Aspen, and
one of them is an hour and twenty minutes longer
than the other. That's your chance, and the only
one,&mdash;to beat 'em to the end of the railroad run.
How are you fixed?"</p>

<p>"For money, you mean? I have the wreck of a
ten-dollar note and a hotel bill to pay."</p>

<p>Bartrow spun around on his heel and shot a sudden
question at the hotel clerk, the answer to which
was inaudible to Jeffard. But Bartrow's rejoinder
was explanatory.</p>

<p>"Rooms over the bank, you say? That's lucky."
This to the clerk; and then to Jeffard: "Come
along with me; this is no time to stick at trifles.
You've got to have money, suddenly, and plenty of it."</p>

<p>But Jeffard hung back.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do, Dick?"</p>

<p>"Stake you and let you try for a special engine
over the short line. Those fellows took the long
way around, as I say,&mdash;why, I don't know, because
both trains leave at the same time. The running
time the way they have gone is five hours and forty-five
minutes. By the other line it's only four hours
and twenty-five minutes. Savez?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but"&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>"Weed out the 'buts' and come along. We're
due to rout a man out of bed and make him open a
bank vault. I can't put my hand into my pocket
for you, as I'd like to; but I know a banker, and
my credit's good."</p>

<p>They found the cashier of the Carbonate City
National in the midst of his toilet. He was an
Eastern man of conservative habit, but he was sufficiently
Occidentalized to grasp the main points in
Bartrow's terse narrative, and to rise to the inexorable
demands of the occasion.</p>

<p>"You know the rule, Mr. Bartrow,&mdash;two good
names; and I don't know your friend. But this
seems to be an eighteen-carat emergency. Take
that key and go down the back way into the bank.
You'll find blank notes on the public desk. Make
out your paper for what Mr. Jeffard will need, and
I'll be with you in half a minute."</p>

<p>They found the way and the blank, which latter
Bartrow hastily filled out, indorsed, and handed to
Jeffard for signature. It was for five hundred dollars,
and the proletary's hand shook when he dipped
the pen.</p>

<p>"It's too much," he protested; "I can't stand
it, Dick. It is like putting a whetted sword into
the hands of a madman."</p>

<p>That was his first reference to the past and its
smirched record, and Bartrow promptly toppled it
into the abyss of generalities.</p>

<p>"Same old hair-splitter, aren't you? What's
the matter with you now?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>"You know&mdash;better than any one. I am not to
be trusted with any such sum of money."</p>

<p>"Call it Garvin's, then. I don't know how you
feel toward Jim, but I've always found him a man
to tie to."</p>

<p>A woman would have said that Jeffard turned
aside to hide an upflash of emotion, though a clot on
the pen was the excuse. But it was the better part
of him that made answer.</p>

<p>"I owe him my life&mdash;twice, Dick. By all the
known hypotheses of honor and gratitude and common
decency I ought to be true to him now, in this
his day of helplessness. But when one has eaten and
drunk and slept with infamy"&mdash;</p>

<p>The cashier's step was on the stair, and Bartrow
cut in swiftly.</p>

<p>"Jeffard, you make me weary!&mdash;and, incidentally,
you're killing precious time. Can't you see
that trust isn't a matter of much or little? If you
can't, why just name the amount for which you'd
be tempted to drop Garvin, and we'll cut under it
so as to be on the safe side."</p>

<p>"But I sha'n't need a fifth of this," Jeffard
objected, wavering.</p>

<p>"You are liable to need more. You must remember
that ten minutes hence you'll be trying to
subsidize a railroad company. Sign that note and
quit quibbling about it."</p>

<p>The thing was done, but when the money had
changed hands, Jeffard quibbled again.</p>

<p>"If the worst comes, you can't afford to pay that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
note, Bartrow; and my probability hangs on a hundred
hazards. What if I fail?"</p>

<p>The cashier had unlocked the street door for
them, and Bartrow ran the splitter of hairs out to
the sidewalk.</p>

<p>"You're not going to fail if I can ever succeed
in getting you in motion. Good Lord, man! can't
you wake up and get a grip of the situation? It
isn't the mere saving or losing of the bonanza; it's
sheer life or death to Jim Garvin&mdash;and you say
you owe him. Here,&mdash;this cab is as good as any.
Midland office, my man; half time, double fare.
Don't spare the leather."</p>

<p>At eight-ten to the minute they were negotiating
with the superintendent's chief clerk for a special
engine to Aspen. Whereupon, as is foreordained
in such crises, difficulties multiplied themselves,
while the office clock's decorous pendulum ticked off
the precious margin of time. Bartrow fought this
battle, fought it single-handed and won; but that
was because his weapon was invincible. The preliminary
passage at arms vocalized itself thus:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>The Clerk</i>, mindful of his superior's moods, and
reflectively dubitant: "I'm afraid I haven't the
authority. You will have to wait and see the superintendent.
He'll be down at nine."</p>

<p><i>Bartrow</i>: "Make it a dollar a mile."</p>

<p><i>The Clerk</i>: "Can't be done; or, at least, I can't
do it. We're short of motive power. There isn't
an engine fit for the run at this end of the division."</p>

<p><i>Bartrow</i>: "Say a hundred and fifty for the trip."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Clerk</i>: "I'm afraid we couldn't make it,
anyhow. We'd have to send a caller after a crew,
and"&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Bartrow</i>, sticking to his single text like a phonograph
set to repeat: "Call it a hundred and seventy-five."</p>

<p><i>The Clerk</i>, in a desperate aside: "Heavens! I
wish the old man would come!"&mdash;and aloud&mdash;"Say,
I don't believe we could better the passenger
schedule, even with a light engine. It's fast&mdash;four
hours and twenty-five"&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Bartrow</i>: "Make it two hundred."</p>

<p>Jeffard counted out the money while the office
operator was calling the engine-dispatcher; and at
eight-twenty they were pacing the station platform,
waiting for the ordered special. Bartrow looked at
his watch.</p>

<p>"If you get away from here at eight-thirty, you'll
have three hours and thirty-five minutes for the run,
which is just fifty minutes better than the regular
schedule. It'll be nip and tuck, but if your engineer
is any good he'll make it. Do you know what to
do when you reach Aspen?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes; I'll meet Garvin when his train
arrives, cut him out of the tangle with the sharks, get
him on a horse and ride for life across the range."</p>

<p>"That's the scheme. But what if the other fellows
object?"</p>

<p>Jeffard straightened himself unconsciously. "I'm
not uncertain on that side; I can fight for it, if that
is what you mean."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>Bartrow looked him up and down with a smile
which was grimly approbative. "Your summer's
done you a whole lot of good, Jeffard. You look
like a grown man."</p>

<p>"As I didn't when you last saw me. But I'm
afraid I am neither better nor worse, Dick,&mdash;morally."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! You can't help being one or the
other. And that reminds me: you haven't accounted
for yourself yet. Can you do it in the
hollow of a minute?"</p>

<p>"Just about. Garvin picked me out of the gutter
and took me with him on this prospecting trip.
That's all."</p>

<p>"But you ought to have left word with somebody.
It was rough on your friends to drop out as if you'd
dodged the undertaker."</p>

<p>"Who was there to care?"</p>

<p>"Well, I cared, for one; and then there is
Lansdale, and&mdash;and"&mdash;</p>

<p>"I know," said Jeffard humbly. He was hungry
for news, but he went fasting on the thinnest paring
of inquiry. "Does she remember me yet?"</p>

<p>Bartrow nodded. "She's not of the forgetting
kind. I never go to Denver that she doesn't ask
me if I've heard of you. But that's Connie Elliott,
every day in the week. She's got a heartful of her
own just now, too, I take it, but that doesn't make
any difference. She's everybody's sister, just the
same."</p>

<p>"A&mdash;a heartful of her own, you say? I don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
quite understand." Jeffard was staring intently
down the empty railway yard, and the glistening
lines of steel were blurred for him.</p>

<p>It was a situation for a bit of merciful diplomacy,
but Bartrow the tactless blundered on remorselessly.</p>

<p>"Why, yes,&mdash;with Lansdale, you know. I
don't know just how far it has gone, but if I were
going to put money on it, I'd say she would let her
life be shortened year for year if his could be spun
out in proportion."</p>

<p>Jeffard brought himself up with a savage turn.
Who was he that he should be privileged as those
who are slain in any honorable cause?</p>

<p>"Lansdale is no better, then?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Sometimes he thinks he is.
But I guess it's written in the book; and I'm
sorry&mdash;for his sake and hers. There comes your
automobile."</p>

<p>A big engine was clanking up through the yard,
but Jeffard did not turn to look at it. He was
wringing Bartrow's hand, and trying vainly to think
of some message to send to the woman he loved.
And at the end of it, it went unsaid. One of the
clerks was waiting with the train-order when the
engine steamed up; and Jeffard was fain to clamber
to his place in the cab, full to the lips with tender
embassies, which would by no means array themselves
in words.</p>

<p>Bartrow waited till he could fling his God-speed
up to the cab window. It took the form of a parting
injunction, and neither of them suspected how
much it would involve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you need backing in Aspen, look up Mark
Denby. He's a good friend of mine; an all-around
business man, and a guardian angel to fellows with
holes in the ground and no ready money. Hunt
him up. I'll wire your introduction and have it
there ahead of you. Off you go&mdash;good luck to
you!"</p>

<p>And at the word the big engine lifted its voice
with a shout and a bell-clang, and shook itself free
for the race.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">From</span> Leadville to the point in the sky-line of the
Continental Divide where the southern shoulder of
Mount Massive dips to Hagerman's Pass, the railway
grade climbs with the old Glenwood trail; and
when Malta was left behind and the ascent fairly
begun, Jeffard had fleeting glimpses of the road
over which he and Garvin and the patient burro had
toiled eastward the day before. From outer curves
and promontories doubled at storming speed the
hoof-beaten trail flicked into view and disappeared;
and at times the brief vistas framed a reminiscent
picture of two foot-weary pilgrims plodding doggedly
in the wake of a pack-laden ass.</p>

<p>It was impossible to conceive that these phantoms
belonged to to-day's yesterday. The crowding
events of a few hours had already pushed them into
a far-away past; their entities were lost in the
kaleidoscopic whirl which had transformed the two
men no less than their prefigurings. What had the
foolish witling raving yonder on his way to despoilment
and death with the two plunderers in common
with the self-contained son of the wilderness, who
had but yesterday been his brother's keeper in a
world of disheartenment? And this other; steam-hurrying
on his way to the same goal, with set jaw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
and tight lips and resolute purpose in his eyes; by
how much or little could he be identified with the
undeterminate one, whose leaden-footed trudgings
the storming locomotive was taking in reverse?</p>

<p>Through some such cycle the wheel of reflection
rolled around to its starting point in things present,
and Jeffard awoke to the moving realities of steep
grades and breath-cutting curves, yawning abysses
and hurtling cliffs, flitting backward to the cacophone
<i>obbligato</i> of the exhaust and the clangorous
cries of racking machinery. The engineer braced
on his box was a muscular giant, with the jaw of a
prizefighter, and steel-gray eyes that had long since
looked death out of countenance. Jeffard took his
measure in an appraisive glance. "If your engineer
is good for anything," Bartrow had said; and the
glance slew the conditional doubt. What a fearless
driver of fast locomotives might do toward reversing
the fate of the besotted one would be done.</p>

<p>In the mean time the race was to the judicious
rather than to the swift. The interminable succession
of grades and curves clogged the wheels, and
the great engine snorted and wallowed on its upward
way, slowing down at times until the throbbing puffs
of the escaping steam seemed to beat no more than
leisurely minuet-time. But the climbing miles to
the summit of the pass were measured doggedly, if
not with speed. No trifling advantage of tangent
or "let-up" was passed without fresh spurrings of
the throttle; and when the engine swept around the
long curve which is the approach to the telegraph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
station at the summit tunnel, the engineer glanced
at his watch and nodded across to his passenger.</p>

<p>"We're goin' to make it," he said, in answer to
Jeffard's shouted inquiry. "It'll be a close call,
but the old Ninety-seven's a bird."</p>

<p>At the station the operator tossed a telegram
through the cab window. It was from Bartrow, and
its major purpose was to give the figures of the
assay, which he had obtained from the little German.
They were sufficiently significant, and Bartrow's
added urgings were unnecessary. "I'm standing
over the train dispatcher here with a club," he
wired. "Don't make any economical mistake at
your end of the string."</p>

<p>The engineer had finished oiling around and had
clambered back to his box. The water supply was
replenished, and the fireman was uprearing the tank-spout.
Jeffard crossed the footboard and thrust a
little roll of bank notes between the fingers of the
brawny hand on the throttle lever. The engineer
smoothed the bills on his knee and wagged his head
as one doubtful.</p>

<p>"That's pretty well up to a month's pay."</p>

<p>"Well, you are going to earn it."</p>

<p>"Better keep it till I do," said the stalwart one,
offering it back.</p>

<p>"No; I'm not afraid to pay you in advance.
You are going to do your best, and I am not trying
to bribe you. It's yours, whether we make it or
not."</p>

<p>The big man thrust the bills into his pocket and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
opened the throttle. "You go over there and sit
down and hold your hair on," he commanded.
"I'm goin' to break the record when we get out
into daylight on the other side o' the mountain."</p>

<p>Jeffard was still groping for hand and foot holds
on the fireman's seat when the locomotive rolled out
of the western portal of the summit tunnel and the
record-breaking began. Of the brain-benumbing
rush down the gorges of the Frying Pan on a flying
locomotive, one recalls but a confused memory; a
phantasmagoric jumble of cliffs and chasms, backward-flitting
forests and gyrating mountain peaks,
trestles and culverts roaring beneath the drumming
wheels, the shrieks of the whistle and the intermittent
stridor of escaping steam in the iron throat of
the safety-valve; a goblin dance of matter in motion
to a war blast of chaotic uproar. One sets the
teeth to endure, and comes back to the cosmic point
of view with a deep-drawn sigh of relief when the
goblin dance is over, and the engine halts at the
junction where the Aspen branch leaves the main
line and crosses the Frying Pan to begin the ascent
of the Roaring Fork.</p>

<p>From this point the competing railways parallel
each other, and at the junction the trains on either
line are within whistle call. To the engineer's question
the telegraph operator nodded an affirmative.</p>

<p>"Yep; she's just gone by. That's her whistlin'
for Emma now. What's the rush?&mdash;backed to
beat her into Aspen?"</p>

<p>The engineer nodded in his turn, and signed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
order for the right of way on the branch. A minute
later the junction station was also a memory,
and Jeffard was straining his eyes for a glimpse of
the passenger train on the other line. A short distance
to the southward the rival lines meet and cross,
exchanging river banks for the remainder of the
run to Aspen. The passenger train was first at
the crossing, and Jeffard had his glimpse as the
engine slackened speed. Not to lose a rail-length
in the hard-fought race, Jeffard's man ran close to
the crossing to await his turn, and the light engine
came to a stand within pistol shot of the train, which
was slowly clanking over the crossing-frogs. Jeffard
slipped from his seat and went over to the engineer's
gangway. It would be worth something if he could
make sure that Garvin was on the train.</p>

<p>The espial was rewarded and punished in swift
sequence. The trucks of the smoking-car were
jolting over the crossing, and Jeffard saw the head
and shoulders of the insane one filling an open window.
It was conspicuously evident that Garvin had
drained the bottle to the frenzy mark. He was
yelling like a lost soul, and shaking impotent fists at
the halted engine. Jeffard's eye measured the distance
to the moving car. It was but down one
embankment and up the other.</p>

<p>"That's my man," he said quickly to the engineer.
"Do you suppose I could make it across?"</p>

<p>"Dead easy," was the reply; and Jeffard swung
down to the step of the engine to drop off. The
impulse saved his life. As he quitted his hold a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
hairy arm bared to the elbow was thrust out of the
window next to the yelling maniac. There was a
glint of sun-rays on polished metal, and a pistol ball
bit out the corner of the cab under the engineer's
arm-rest. Jeffard desisted, and climbed to his place
when the moving train gathered headway.</p>

<p>"Damn a crazy loon, anyway," said the engineer,
much as one might pass the time of day. "They'd
ought to have sense enough to take his gun away
from him."</p>

<p>Jeffard explained in a sentence. "It wasn't
the crazy one; it was one of the two cut-throats
who are kidnaping him&mdash;the fellows I'm trying
to beat."</p>

<p>"The fellers you're goin' to beat," corrected the
engineer. "We'll head 'em off now if the Ninety-seven
goes in on three legs. The gall o' the cusses!&mdash;why,
they might ha' shot somebody!"</p>

<p>From the crossing in the lower valley neither line
encounters any special obstacle to speed; and under
equal conditions a locomotive race up the Roaring
Fork might be an affair of seconds and rail lengths
for the victor. But the light engine with regardless
orders speedily distanced the passenger train with
stops to make; and when the smokes of the mountain-girt
town at the head of the valley came in
sight, the big engineer pulled his watch and shouted
triumphant:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Eleven-forty,&mdash;and their time's twelve-five.
We'll be twenty minutes to the good in spite o'"&mdash;</p>

<p>It is conceivable that he would have used a strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
figure, but the depravity of things inanimate took
the word out of his mouth. There was a tearing
crash to the rear; a shock as if a huge projectile
had overtaken them; and the flying locomotive came
to earth like an eagle with a mangled wing. It was
a broken axle under the tender; a tested steel shaft
which had outlived the pounding race across the
mountains only to fall apart in the last level mile of
the home stretch. Jeffard clambered down with the
enginemen, and saw defeat, crushing and definite,
in the wreck under the tender. But the big engineer
was a man for a crisis. One glance at the
wreck sufficed, and the fireman got his orders in
shot-like sentences.</p>

<p>"Up with you, Tom, and give her the water,&mdash;both
injectors! Drop me the sledge, and get the
pinch-bar under the head o' that couplin'-pin when
I drive it up. Give her a scoop 'r two o' coal&mdash;'nough
to run in with. By cripes! we'll beat 'em
yet!"</p>

<p>The minced oath came from beneath the engine,
and was punctuated by mighty upward blows of the
sledge hammer on the coupling-pin, whose head was
rising by half-inch impulses from its seat in the footplate.
Jeffard saw and understood. The engineer
meant to cut loose from the wreck and finish the
run without the tender.</p>

<p>"Use me if you can," he offered. "What shall
I do?"</p>

<p>"Climb up there and help Tom with that bar.
If we can pull this pin we're in it yet."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>Jeffard laid hold with the fireman, and together
they pried at the reluctant pin. It yielded at length,
but when the engineer had disconnected the water
and air hose and mounted to his place in the cab,
the roar of the oncoming passenger train was ajar in
the air.</p>

<p>"You stay with the wreck, Tom, and flag it!"
was the final command; and then to Jeffard, as the
engine shot away from its disabled member: "How
much time have you got to have?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. It depends upon how much
those fellows have found out, and how drunk my
partner is. At the worst, a minute or two will
serve."</p>

<p>It was still to be had, but in the very yard a
thrown switch intervened, and the small margin
vanished. The passenger train was in, and Jeffard
saw defeat again; but he dropped from the locomotive
and ran up the yard, forgetting in the heat of
it that he had elided two meals in the twenty-four
hours. The final dash brought its reward. He
took the first vehicle that offered and reached the
principal hotel in time to see Garvin and his keepers
descend from a carriage at the entrance.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; in one moment. Those three fellows
who came in just now? They've gone up to their
room. Be with us over night?"</p>

<p>Thus the hotel clerk in answer to Jeffard's gasping
inquiry. To whom the proletary, fighting desperately
for some semblance of equanimity:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I'll be here indefinitely; no, I have no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
baggage; I'll pay in advance. Can you give me
the room next to these men? The crazy one is my
partner, and I'll be responsible for him."</p>

<p>The clerk hesitated, but Jeffard won his cause
without knowing it by the necessary parade of bank-notes
in the pecuniary affair.</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir; the boy will show you up. You
won't trouble him? All right; Number Nineteen&mdash;second
floor, third door to the right. Dinner is
served, when you're ready."</p>

<p>If Jeffard had forgotten his directions the uproar
in Number Eighteen would have guided him.
Garvin's voice, uplifted in alternate malediction and
maudlin bathos, jarred upon the air of the corridor.
Jeffard paused. The long chase was ended and
only a pine door intervened between pursuer and
pursued. He laid a hand on the doorknob. His
breath came hard, and the veins in his forehead
were like knotted whipcords. While he paused
some broken babblings from within wrought a swift
change in him. The knotted veins relaxed and he
laughed, not mirthfully but with a cynical upcurve
of the lip. His hand slipped from the doorknob,
and he stole away, cat-like, to let himself noiselessly
into the adjoining room.</p>

<p>There was a door of communication between the
two rooms, bolted on Jeffard's side, and with the
knob removed. He went on his knees to the square
hole through the lock, but the angle of vision included
no more than a blank patch of the opposite
wall. Then he laid his ear to the aperture. Out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
of the jangling discord beyond the door came fragmentary
lucidities pieceable together into a strand
of sequence. Garvin had told all he knew, or all
he could remember, and the robbery paused at the
trivial detail of the most feasible route over the
mountains from Aspen. But to make sure, and
possibly to provide against the contingency of having
to eliminate Garvin, some rude map was needed;
and this one of the plunderers was evidently trying
to draw under instructions from the witling.
At the mention of a map, Jeffard rummaged his
pockets without taking his ear from the door. From
one of them he drew a crumpled bit of paper,
thumbed and crease-broken. It was Garvin's map
of the claim and the trail, passed over for inspection
in the hollow of a certain lambent evening months
before and never returned.</p>

<p>Who shall say what was behind the inscrutable
darkling of the eyes of him when he returned the
paper to his pocket and bent to listen with four
senses lending their acuteness to the fifth? Was it
a softening memory of the loving-kindnesses of one
James Garvin to a man soul-sick and body-wasted,
snatched as a charred brand out of a fire of his own
kindling? Or was it the stirring of a ruthless devil
of self; a devil never more than dormant in any
heart insurgent; a fell demon of the pit whose
arousing waits only upon opportunity, whose power
is to transform pity into remorseless ingratitude and
ruth into relentless greed? There was room for
the alternative.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here; take another nip o' this and pull yourself
together,"&mdash;it was the voice of the hawk-faced
one. "If you wasn't such a howlin' idiot you'd see
that we're the only friends you've got. I keep
a-tellin' you that that slick pardner o' yours was on
that wild ingine, and if you don't sink a shaft on
your wits he's a-goin' to do you up cold!"</p>

<p>The appeal brought blood as a blow. The crash
of an overturned chair was followed by an explosion
of cursings, the outcries of a soul in torment. And
when the madman choked in the fullness of it, a
voice said: "Pick up that chair, Pete, and pull him
down. He'll be seein' things in a minute, and
that'll settle the whole shootin'-match." There was a
struggle short but violent, the jar of a forcible downsetting,
and a sound as of one flinging his arms abroad
upon the table. After which the tormented one became
brokenly articulate. What he said is unrecordable.
With maudlin oath and thick-tongued
ravings he rehearsed his fancied wrongs and breathed
forth promises of vengeance, calling down the wrath
of the spheres upon one Henry Jeffard and his posterity
to the third and fourth generation.</p>

<p>"That's all right; I'd kill him on sight, if I
was you. But just now you're killin' time, instid.
First you know, he'll be on his way acrost the
range, and then where'll you be? You don't even
know that he didn't locate that claim before you
came out. Git down to business and tell us where
that valley is, if you ever knowed. You said it was
on a creek"&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>Jeffard rose and went softly across the room to
sit on the edge of the bed. The unfathomable light
was still in his eyes, and his thought wrought itself
into words.</p>

<p>"It's done; they'll wring it out of him, and then
fling him aside like so much offal. I wonder if it is
worth while to try to save it&mdash;for him. What good
would it do him?&mdash;or, rather, what evil thing is
there that it wouldn't make possible for him? What
devil of curiosity led me to open this Pandora-box
of responsibility? For I am responsible, first for
the finding, and now for the keeping, and hereafter
for what shall come of it. That is, if I save it&mdash;for
him." He got upon his feet and tiptoed back
to the door of communication, listening once more.
The clamor had quieted down, and the scratching of
a pen gnawed the silence. Then came the voice of
the hawk-faced one.</p>

<p>"There she is; you sign your name right there
and it'll be all right. It's the only way; you're
too drunk to pull strings with that pardner o' yours,
and we're goin' to stand by you, see? All we want
is the authority."</p>

<p>Jeffard started back and made as if he would
fling himself against the locked door. Then he
thought better of it.</p>

<p>"That simplifies it," he mused, pacing up and
down with noiseless steps. "He has signed away
whatever right he had, and now it's my turn. If I
pay the price I can checkmate them. But can I
pay the price? Surely, if any man can; I, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
have deliberately turned my back upon the world's
approval for a much less thing. And in the end
the money will atone."</p>

<p>A stir in the adjoining room admonished him that
the time for action had come. He wheeled quickly
and let himself into the corridor. A key was rattling
in the lock of Number Eighteen as he passed,
but he found the stair before the bolt was shot. In
the lobby he stopped to ask a hurried question of a
man who was opening his mail at the public writing-table.
The question was answered curtly, but the
man left his letters and went to the door to point
the reply.</p>

<p>"I see it; thank you," said Jeffard; and went
his way rapidly, with now and then a glance behind
him as if to make sure that he was not followed.</p>

<p>In a few minutes he came back, walking slowly,
with his head down and his hands in the pockets of
the brown duck miner's coat. There was a knot of
loungers in front of the hotel, gathered about the
door and peering in; a group of curious ones, which
grew by accretions from the by-passers. A disturbance
of some sort was afoot in the lobby&mdash;two
persuasive ones struggling peaceably with a drunken
man, while the bystanders looked on with smiles
pitying or cynical, each after his kind.</p>

<p>Jeffard pushed into the circle, and those who remarked
him said that he seemed to see nothing but
the struggling trio. Some of the onlookers were
near enough to hear what he said to the two who
were not drunk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>"The game is closed, gentlemen, and you are out
of it. When you get on the ground you will find
the claim located&mdash;in my name."</p>

<p>Two right hands made simultaneous backward
dips, and two potential murderers apparently realized
the folly of it at the same instant. But the drunken
one spun around with his face ablaze, a fiercer madness
than that of drink burning in his bloodshot
eyes.</p>

<p>"You? You played the sneak an' located hit
behind my back? In your name, d' ye say?&mdash;your
name? Well, by God, you hain't got a name!"</p>

<p>A pistol cracked with the oath, and Jeffard put
his hands to his head and pitched forward. The
crowd fell back aghast, to surge inward again with
a rush when the reaction came. Then a shout was
raised at the door, and the haggard manslayer, cured
now of all madness save that of fear, burst through
the inpressing throng and disappeared.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Even</span> in a Colorado mining town a shooting affray
at midday in the lobby of the principal hotel creates
more or less of a sensation, and it was fully fifteen
minutes before the buzz of public comment subsided
sufficiently to suffer Mr. Mark Denby to go back to
his letters and telegrams. He had made one in the
circle of onlookers; had seen and heard, and, now
that the wounded man had been carried to his room
and cared for, and the hunt was up and afield for
the would-be murderer, was willing to forget. But
a traveling salesman at the opposite blotting-pad
must needs keep the pool astir.</p>

<p>"Say, wasn't that the most cold-blooded thing
you ever saw? 'Y gad! I've heard that these
Western towns were fearfully tough, but I had no
idea a man wouldn't be safe to sit down and write
his house in the lobby of a decent hotel. 'Pon my
word, I actually heard the 'zip' of that bullet!"</p>

<p>Denby looked across at the hinderer of oblivion,
and remembered that the salesman had been well to
the rear of the battery in action. Wherefore he
said, with a touch of the gravest irony: "You'll
get used to it, after a bit. Suppose you take a spin
around the block in the open air; that will doubtless
steady your nerves so you can write the house without
a quiver."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>"Think it would? I believe I'll try it; I can't
hold a pen still to save my life. But say, I might
happen to run up against that fellow, and he might
recognize me and think I was after him."</p>

<p>"In which case he would in all probability draw
and quarter you and take your scalp for a memento.
On second thought, I don't know but you're safer
where you are."</p>

<p>The mere suggestion was perspiratory, and the
traveling man mopped his face. But there are occasions
when one must talk or burst, and presently he
began again.</p>

<p>"Say, I suppose they'll lynch that fellow if they
catch him, won't they?"</p>

<p>The badgered one came to attention with a fine-lined
frown of annoyance radiating fan-like above
his eyes. He was of the stuff of which man-masters
are made; a well-knit figure of a man, rather under
than over the average of height and breadth, but so
fairly proportioned as to give the impression of unmeasured
strength in reserve,&mdash;the strength of steel
under silk. His face was bronzed with the sun-stain
of the altitudes, but it was as smooth as a child's,
and beardless, with thin lips and masterful eyes of
the sort that can look unmoved upon things unnamable.</p>

<p>"Lynch him? Oh, no; you do us an injustice,"
he said, and the tone was quite as level as the eye-volley.
"We don't lynch people out here for shooting,&mdash;only
for talking too much."</p>

<p>Whereat one may picture unacclimated loquacity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
gasping and silenced, with the owner of the "Chincapin"
and other listed properties going on to read
his letters and telegrams in peace. The process
furthered itself in the sequence of well-ordered
dispatch until a message, damp from the copying-press
and dated at Leadville, came to the surface.
It covered two of the yellow sheets in the spacious
handwriting of the receiving operator, and Denby
read it twice, and yet once again, before laying it
aside. Whatever it was, it was not suffered to interrupt
the orderly sequence of things; and Denby
had read the last of the letters before he held up a
summoning finger for a bell-boy.</p>

<p>"Go and ask the clerk the name of the man who
was shot, will you?"</p>

<p>The information came in two words, and the
querist gathered up his papers and sent the boy for
his room key. At the stairhead he met the surgeon
and stopped him to ask about the wounded man.</p>

<p>"How are you, Doctor? What is the verdict?
Is there a fighting chance for him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; much more than that. It isn't as
bad as it might have been; the skull isn't fractured.
But it was enough to knock him out under the circumstances.
He had skipped two or three meals,
he tells me, and was under a pretty tense strain of
excitement."</p>

<p>"Then he is conscious?"</p>

<p>The physician laughed. "Very much so. He is
sitting up to take my prescription,&mdash;which was a
square meal. Whatever the strain was, it isn't off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
yet. He insists that he must mount and ride this
afternoon if he has to be lashed in the saddle; has
already ordered a horse, in fact. He is plucky."</p>

<p>"Then he is able to talk business, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Able, yes; but if you can get anything out of
him, you'll do better than I could. He won't talk,&mdash;won't
even tell what the row was about."</p>

<p>"Won't he?" The man of affairs crossed the
corridor and tapped on the door of Number Nineteen.
There was no response, and he turned the
knob and entered. The shades were drawn and
there was a cleanly odor of aseptics in the air of the
darkened room. The wounded man was propped
among pillows on the bed, with a well-furnished tea-tray
on his knees. He gave prompt evidence of his
ability to talk.</p>

<p>"Back again, are you? I told you I had nothing
to say for publication, and I meant it." This wrathfully;
then he discovered his mistake, but the tone
of the careless apology was scarcely more conciliatory.
"Oh&mdash;excuse me. I thought it was the
reporter."</p>

<p>Bartrow's correspondent found a chair and introduced
himself with charitable directness. "My
name is Denby. I am here because Mr. Richard
Bartrow wires me to look you up."</p>

<p>Jeffard delayed the knife and fork play long
enough to say: "Denby?&mdash;oh, yes; I remember.
Thank you," and there the interview bade fair to
die of inanition. Jeffard went on with his dinner
as one who eats to live; and Denby tilted his chair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
gently and studied his man as well as he might in
the twilight of the drawn shades. After a time, he
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Bartrow bespeaks my help for you. He says
your affair may need expediting: does it?"</p>

<p>Jeffard's rejoinder was almost antagonistic. "How
much do you know of the affair?"</p>

<p>"What the whole town knows by this time&mdash;added
to what little Bartrow tells me in his wire.
You or your partner have stumbled upon an abandoned
claim which promises to be a bonanza. One
of you&mdash;public rumor is a little uncertain as to
which one&mdash;tried to euchre the other; and it seems
that you have won in the race to the Recorder's
office, and have come out of it alive. Is that the
summary?"</p>

<p>He called it public rumor, but it was rather a
shrewd guess. Jeffard did not hasten to confirm it.
On the contrary, his reply was evasive.</p>

<p>"You may call it an hypothesis&mdash;a working
hypothesis, if you choose. What then?"</p>

<p>The promoter was not of those who swerve from
conclusions. "It follows that you are a stout fighter,
and a man to be helped, or a very great rascal," he
said coolly.</p>

<p>Again the knife and fork paused, and the
wounded man's gaze was at least as steady as that of
his conditional accuser. "It may simplify matters,
Mr. Denby, if I say that I expect nothing from
public rumor."</p>

<p>The mine-owner shrugged his shoulders as an unwilling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
arbiter who would fain wash his hands of the
ethical entanglement if he could.</p>

<p>"It's your own affair, of course,&mdash;the public
opinion part of it. But it may prove to be worth
your while not to ignore the suffrages of those who
make and unmake reputations."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because you will need capital,&mdash;honest capital,&mdash;and"&mdash;</p>

<p>He left the sentence in the air, and Jeffard
brought it down with a cynical stonecast.</p>

<p>"And, under the circumstances, an honest capitalist
might hesitate, you would say. Possibly; but
capital, as I know it, is not so discriminating when
the legal requirements are satisfied. There will be
no question of ownership involved in the development
of the 'Midas.'"</p>

<p>"Legal ownership, you mean?"</p>

<p>"Legal or otherwise. When the time for investment
comes, I shall be abundantly able to assure the
capitalist."</p>

<p>"To guarantee the investment: doubtless. But
capital is not always as unscrupulous as you seem to
think."</p>

<p>"No?"&mdash;the tilt of the negative was almost
aggressive. "There are borrowers and borrowers,
Mr. Denby. It's the man without collateral who
is constrained to make a confidant of his banker."</p>

<p>The blue-gray eyes of the master of men looked
their levelest, and the clean-shaven face was
shrewdly inscrutable. "Pardon me, Mr. Jeffard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
but there are men who couldn't borrow with the
Orizaba behind them."</p>

<p>Jeffard parried the eye-thrust, and brushed the
generalities aside in a sentence.</p>

<p>"All of which is beside the mark, and I have
neither the strength nor the inclination to flail it
out with you. As you say, I shall need capital&mdash;yours
or another's. State the case&mdash;yours, or mine,&mdash;in
so many words, if you please."</p>

<p>"Briefly, then: the equity in this affair lies between
you and the man who tried to kill you. I
mean by this that the bonanza is either yours or his.
If it were a partnership discovery there would have
been no chance for one of you to overreach the
other. You'll hardly deny that there was a sharp
fight for possession: you both advertised that fact
pretty liberally."</p>

<p>Jeffard was listening with indifference, real or
feigned, and he neither denied nor affirmed. "Go
on."</p>

<p>"From the point of view of an unprejudiced
observer the evidence is against your partner. He
comes here drunk and abusive, in company with two
men whose faces would condemn them anywhere, and
squanders his lead in the race in a supplementary
carouse. And a little later, when he finds that you
have outclassed him, he shoots you down like a dog
in a fit of drunken fury. To an impartial onlooker
the inference is fairly obvious."</p>

<p>"And that is?"&mdash;</p>

<p>"That your partner is the scoundrel; that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
discovery is yours, and that he and his accomplices
were trying to rob you. I don't mind saying that
this is my own inference, but I shall be glad to have
it confirmed."</p>

<p>Jeffard looked up quickly. "Then Bartrow
hasn't told you"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Bartrow's message was merely introductory;
two pages of eulogy, in fact, as any friendly office
of Dick's is bound to be. He doesn't go into
details."</p>

<p>Jeffard put the tea-tray aside and with it the air
of abstraction, and in a better light his interlocutor
would not have failed to remark the swift change
from dubiety to assurance.</p>

<p>"Will you bear with me, Mr. Denby, if I say
that your methods are a little indirect? You say
that the evidence is against James Garvin, and yet
you give me to understand that it will be well if I
can clear myself."</p>

<p>"Exactly; a word of assurance is sometimes
worth many deductions."</p>

<p>"But if, for reasons of my own, I refuse to say
the word?"</p>

<p>The promoter's shrug was barely perceptible.
"I don't see why you should refuse."</p>

<p>Jeffard went silent at that, lying back with closed
eyes and no more than a twitching of the lips to show
that he was not asleep. After what seemed an interminable
interval to the mine-owner, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I do refuse, for the present. A few days later,
when I have done what I have to do, there will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
time enough to discuss ways and means&mdash;and
ethics, if you still feel inclined that way. May I
trouble you to run that window-shade up?" He
was sitting on the edge of the bed and groping
beneath it for his shoes.</p>

<p>The promoter admitted the light and ventured a
question.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"Get on the ground with the least possible
delay."</p>

<p>The shoes were found, but when the wounded one
bent to lace them the room spun around and he
would have fallen if Denby had not caught him.</p>

<p>"You're not fit," said the master of men, not unsympathetically.
"You couldn't sit a horse if your
life depended upon it."</p>

<p>"I must; therefore I can and will," Jeffard asserted,
with fine determination. "Be good enough
to ask the bell-boy to come in and lace my shoes."</p>

<p>The man with a mission to compel other men
smiled. His fetish was indomitable resolution, for
himself first, and afterward for those who deserved;
and here was a man who, whatever his lacks and
havings in the ethical field, was at least courageous.
Having admitted so much, the promoter went down
on one knee to lace the courageous one's shoes, dissuading
him, meanwhile.</p>

<p>"You can't go to-day; the wound-fever will come
on presently, and you'll be a sick man. Let it rest
a while. Having put himself on the criminal side
of the fence by trying to kill you, your partner will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
hardly dare to jump the claim in person; he will
have to find a proxy, and that will ask for time,&mdash;more
time than the sheriff-dodging will permit."</p>

<p>"His proxies are here, and they will act without
instructions from him," said Jeffard, with his hands
to his head and his teeth set to keep the words from
shaping themselves into a groan.</p>

<p>"You mean the two who were with him?"</p>

<p>"Yes. So far as the present fight is concerned,
the three are one; and two of them are still free to
act."</p>

<p>"So?&mdash;that's different." Denby finished tying
the second shoe and rose to begin measuring a sentinel's
beat between the window and the door, pacing
evenly with his brows knitted and his hands clasped
behind him. "You know what to expect, then?"</p>

<p>"I know that I have been twice shot at within the
past two hours, and that the moments are golden."</p>

<p>"But you are in no condition to go in and hold it
alone! You'll have to meet force with force. You
ought to have at least three or four good men with
you."</p>

<p>"What I have to do presupposes a clear field,"
said Jeffard guardedly. "If it should come to
blows, the discussion of&mdash;of ethics will be indefinitely
postponed, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>"Humph! I suppose your reasons are as strong
as your obstinacy. How far is it to your claim?"</p>

<p>"I don't know the exact distance; about twenty
miles, I believe. But there is a mountain range
intervening."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>"You can't ride it in your present condition; it's
a sheer physical impossibility."</p>

<p>"I shall ride it."</p>

<p>"What is the use of being an ass?" demanded
the master of men, losing patience for once in a way.
"Don't you see you can't stand alone?"</p>

<p>Jeffard struggled to his feet and wavered across
the room to a chair. Denby laughed,&mdash;a quiet
little chuckle of appreciation.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean literally; I meant in the business
affair. You'll have to have help from the start.
That means that you will have to trust some one.
From what you say it is evident that there will be
an immediate attempt made to jump the claim; an
attempt which will be afoot and on the ground long
before you can get there. Let us be reasonable and
take hold of the live facts. I have a man here who
is both capable and trustworthy. Let me send him
in with a sufficient force to stand off the jumpers
until you are able to hold your own."</p>

<p>Jeffard shook his head. "I can't do it, unreasonable
as it may seem. I must go first and alone.
That is another mystery, you will say, but I can't
help it. If I win through it alive I shall be here
again in a day or two, ready to talk business. More
than that I can't say now."</p>

<p>Denby's thin lips came together in a straight line,
with a click of the white teeth behind them. "As
you please. I am not going about to prove to you
that you would lose nothing by trusting me from the
start. Can I do anything toward helping you off?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; you can give me your shoulder down the
stair and a lift into the saddle."</p>

<p>The little journey to the ground floor was made
in silence. When they were passing the desk the
clerk said: "Your horse is at the door, Mr. Jeffard.
I was just about to send up word. Are you
feeling better?"</p>

<p>"I am all right." He leaned heavily on the
counter and paid his bill. "Did the liveryman
leave any message?"</p>

<p>"No, only to say that he has stocked the saddle-bags
as you directed."</p>

<p>The personally conducted journey went on to the
sidewalk, and Denby heaved the wounded one into
the saddle, steadying him therein till the vertigo
loosed its hold.</p>

<p>"Anything else you can delegate?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you; nothing that I think of."</p>

<p>"You are still determined to go?"</p>

<p>"Quite determined."</p>

<p>"Well, you are a stubborn madman, and I rather
like you for it; that's all I have to say. Good luck
to you."</p>

<p>Jeffard gathered the reins and sat reflective what
time the broncho sniffed the cool breeze pouring
down from the higher slopes of the western range.
When the horse would have set out, Jeffard restrained
him yet another moment.</p>

<p>"You intimated a few minutes ago that I was
afraid to trust you, Mr. Denby," he said, picking
and choosing among the words as one who has a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
difficult course to steer. "I do trust you as far as
I can trust any one at the present crisis, and I'll
prove it." He drew a crumpled bit of paper from
his pocket, and smoothed it upon the pommel of the
saddle. "Here is a rough map of the claim and
the trails by which it may be reached. If I'm not
back in Aspen in three days, fit out your expedition
and go in prepared to take and hold the property.
The men you will find in possession will be robbers,&mdash;and
murderers,&mdash;and you may have to fight for
it; but that won't matter. In the right-hand tunnel
wall, a few feet from the entrance, you will see
a crevice where the dynamite was kept. In the
bottom of that crevice you'll find my last will and
testament, and I'm going to believe that you will
carry out its provisions to the letter."</p>

<p>The promoter's smile was of grimness, with quarterings
of approval.</p>

<p>"Which is to say that you'll be safely dead and
buried. Barring your idiotic stubbornness, you are
a man after my own heart, Mr. Jeffard, and I'll
willingly be your executor. Are you armed?"</p>

<p>"No; I told you it would depend upon speed. I
have no weapons."</p>

<p>"What! And you are going on a forlorn hope
with an even chance of having to fight for your life?
Wait a minute."</p>

<p>He ran back into the hotel, coming out again
presently with a repeating rifle and a well-filled
cartridge belt. "There is such a thing as cold
nerve carried to the vanishing point in foolhardiness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
Mr. Jeffard," he said. "Put this belt on while I
sling the rifle under the saddle-flap. Can you shoot
straight?"</p>

<p>"It is extremely doubtful. A little target practice
as a boy"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Target practice!&mdash;and you may have to stand
off a gang of desperadoes who can clip coins at a
hundred yards! You'd better reconsider and give
me time to organize a posse."</p>

<p>"No; thank you&mdash;for that and everything else.
Good-by."</p>

<p>Denby stood on the curb and watched his man
ride slowly up the street and take the turn toward
the southern mountains. After which he went back
to his place at the public writing-table in the lobby,
picking up the hotel stenographer on the way. For a
preoccupied half-hour he dictated steadily, and when
the last letter was answered got up to pace out the
transcribing interval. In the midst of it he drifted
out to the sidewalk and stood staring absently up
the street, as, an hour earlier, he had gazed after the
lessening figure of the obstinate one. But this time
there were two horsemen in the field of vision wending
their way leisurely to the street-end. Denby,
thinking pointedly of other things, saw them and
saw them not; but when they, too, took the turn to
the southward, he came alive to the probabilities in
the heart of an instant.</p>

<p>"By all that's good!&mdash;they're after him, as sure
as fate!" he muttered; and a little later he was
quizzing the proprietor of a livery stable around the
corner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you know those two fellows who have just
left, Thompson?"</p>

<p>"You bet I don't; and I made 'em put up the
collateral for the whole outfit before they got away."</p>

<p>"Where did you say they were going?"</p>

<p>"Didn't say, did I? But somewheres up Jackfoot
Gulch was what they told me."</p>

<p>"H'm; that is east. And just now they are
riding in another direction. You sold them the
horses, you say?"</p>

<p>The man grinned. "Temp'rarily. I'll take 'em
back at the same price, less the tariff, if I ever see
'em again. I ain't takin' no chances on stray
strangers with any such lookin'-glass-bustin' faces
as they've got. Not much, Mary Ann."</p>

<p>"It is well to be careful. Have you seen my
man Donald since dinner?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he was here just now and said he'd be
back again. Want him?"</p>

<p>Denby looked at his watch. "Yes. If he doesn't
come back within five minutes, send some of the boys
out to hunt him up. Tell him to outfit for himself
and me for two days, and to be at the hotel at
three, sharp. Give him the best horses you can lay
your hands on."</p>

<p>"Always yours to command, Mr. Denby. Anything
else?"</p>

<p>"That's all."</p>

<p>The promoter left the stable and walked quickly
to the hotel. At the entrance he met an acquaintance
and stopped to pass the time of day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>"How are you, Roberts?&mdash;By the way, you are
just the man I wanted to see; saves me a trip to
the Court House. Did a fellow named Jeffard,
J-e-f-f-a-r-d, file a notice and affidavit on a claim
called the 'Midas' just after dinner?"</p>

<p>"No. He came over to ask me if there was any
way in which he could secure himself. It seems
that he neglected to post a notice on the claim before
coming out with his samples,&mdash;why, he didn't
explain."</p>

<p>Denby nodded and went on, talking to himself.
"So!&mdash;that's his little mystery, is it? The 'Midas'
isn't located yet, and until he gets that notice posted
and recorded, it's anybody's bonanza. I hope
Donald can pick up the trail and follow it. If he
can't, there'll be one plucky fellow less in the
world, and two more thugs to be hanged, later on."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">A topographical</span> map of that portion of the
Saguache known as the Elk Mountain Range&mdash;the
spur which forms the watershed between the Gunnison
and the Grand&mdash;will include a primeval valley
gashing the range southeastward from Tourtelotte
on the Ashcroft trail, and heading fifteen miles
farther wildernessward in a windswept pass across
the summit of the watershed. Its watercourse, a
tumbling torrent fed by the melting snows in the
higher gulches, is a tributary of the Roaring Fork;
and a disused pack-trail, which once served a scattered
pioneer corps of prospectors, climbs by tortuous
stages to the windswept pass, now swerving from
bank to bank of the stream, and now heading a
lateral gulch or crossing the point of a barrier spur.</p>

<p>It is a crystalline afternoon in mid-autumn. Indian
summer on the high plateaus of the continent's
crest there is none, but instead, a breathing space of
life-giving days, with the bouquet of fine old wine
in the keen-edged air, and of frosty nights when the
stars swing clear in illimitable space. Positive
coloring, other than the sombre greens of pine and
fir, is lacking. The season of bursting buds and
quickening leaf tints is over, and what little deciduous
vegetation the altitude permits is present only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
in twig traceries and sun-cured range grass. In the
heart of the valley the heights are heavily wooded,
and the sombre greens wall out the world to the sky-line;
but farther on bald slopes and ridges stretch
away above the pines and firs, and the blue arch
of the firmament springs clear from snow-capped
abutments of fallow dun and weathered gray.</p>

<p>In the upper levels of the valley the disused trail
leaves the stream and begins to climb by loops and
zigzags to the pass. On the reverse curve of one of
the loops&mdash;the last but one in the upward path&mdash;a
solitary horseman sends his mount recklessly onward,
heedless alike of stones of stumbling and the
breath-cutting steepness of the way. His head is
bandaged, and he rides loose in the saddle like a
drunken man, swaying and reeling, but evermore
urging the horse by word and blow and the drumming
of unspurred heels. His feet are thrust far
into the stirrups, and at every fresh vantage point
he steadies himself by pommel and cantle to scan
the backward windings of the trail. A man riding
desperately for his life and against time, with a
handicap of physical unfitness, one would say; but
there would seem to be fierce determination in the
unrelenting onpush, as if wounds and weariness
were as yet no more than spurs to goad and whips
to drive.</p>

<p>The reverse curve of the loop ends on the crest
of the last of the barrier spurs, and at the crown of
the ascent the forest thins to right and left, opening
a longer backward vista. On the bare summit the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
rider turns once more in his saddle, and the rearward
glance becomes a steady eye-sweep. In the
bight of the loop which he has just traversed the
trail swings clear of the gulch timber, and while
he gazes two dark objects advancing abreast and
alternately rising and falling to a distance-softened
staccato of pounding hoofs cross the open space and
double the loop. The wounded one measures his
lead. For all his spurrings the distance is decreasing;
and a hasty survey of the trail ahead is not
reassuring. From the bald summit of the spur the
bridle path winds around the head of another gulch,
and the approach to the pass on the farther side is a
snow-banked incline, above timber line, uncovered,
and within easy rifle-shot of the hill of reconnaissance.
What will befall is measurably certain. If
he attempts to head the traversing ravine on the
trail, his pursuers will reach the bald summit, wait,
and pick him off at their leisure while he is scaling
the opposite snowbank.</p>

<p>At the second glance a dubious alternative offers.
The gorge in the direct line may not prove impassable;
there is a slender chance that one may push
straight across and up the opposing slope to the
pass before the guns of the enemy can be brought
into position. Wherefore he sends the horse at a
reckless gallop down the descent to the gorge, making
shift to cling with knee and heel while he disengages
a rifle from its sling under the saddle-flap,
and fills its magazine with cartridges from a belt at
his waist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>At the bottom of the ravine the alternative
vanishes; becomes a thing inexistent, in fact. The
gorge in its lower length is a canyoned slit, a barrier
to be passed only by creatures with wings. To return
is to meet his pursuers on the bald summit of
the spur; to hesitate is equally hazardous. The
horse obeys the sudden wrenching of the rein, spins
as on a pivot, and darts away up the canyon brink.
Fortunately, the timber is sparse, and, luckily again,
a practicable crossing is found well within the longer
detour traced by the trail. For the second time
that day it is a race to the swift; and, as before, an
accident comes between. Horse and man are across
the ravine, are clear of the stunted firs, are mounting
the final snow-banked incline to the pass with
no more than a trooper's dash between them and
safety, when the sure-footed beast slips on the packed
snow of the trail, and horse and man roll together to
the bottom of the declivity.</p>

<p>A few hours earlier this man had been the football
of circumstances, tossed hither and yon as the
buffetings of chance might impel him. But the
pregnant hours have wrought a curious change in
him, for better or worse, and before the breath-cutting
plunge is checked he is free of the struggling
horse and is kicking it to its feet to mount and ride
again, charging the steep uprising with plying lash
and digging heels and shouts of encouragement.
Ten seconds later the trail is regained and the summit
of the pass cuts the sky-line above him. Ten
other flying leaps and a resolute man may hold an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
army at bay. But in the midst of them comes a
clatter of hoofs on the rocky headland across the
gulch, and a nerve-melting instant wherein the hoof-beats
cease and the bleak heights give back a muffled
echo in the rarefied air. The hunted one bends to
the saddle-horn at the crack of the rifle, and the
bullet sings high. A second is better aimed, and at
the shrill hiss of it the snorting horse flattens its
ears and lunges at the ascent with flagging powers
fear-revived. A scrambling bound or two and the
final height is gained, but in the pivoting instant
between danger and safety a third bullet scores the
horse's back and embeds itself in the cantle of the
saddle with a benumbing shock to the rider.</p>

<p>But by this the fugitive is fair Berserk-mad, and
those who would stay him must shoot to kill. Once
out of range beyond the crest of the pass, he drags
the trembling horse to its haunches and whips down
from the saddle, the wine of battle singing in his
veins and red wrath answering for physical fitness.
A hasty glance to make sure that the broncho's
wound is not disabling, and he is back at the summit
of the pass, sheltering himself behind a rock and
sending shot after shot across the ravine at his
assailants. The fusillade is harmless; wounds, mad
gallops, and red wrath being easily subversive of
accuracy in target practice; but it has the effect of
sending the enemy to the rear in discreet haste,
with the dropping shots beating quick time for the
double quartette of trampling hoofs as the twain
gallop out of range behind the bald headland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>For a resolute half-hour, while the undertow of
the ebbing minutes steadily undermines the props and
shores set up by Berserk wrath, the solitary rifleman
lies watchful and vigilant. Thrice in that interval
have the attackers rallied; once in a desperate
charge to gain the cover of the timber on the canyon's
brink, and twice in equally desperate efforts
to turn the rifleman's position by following the
looping of the trail. Notwithstanding the bad
marksmanship of the garrison the position has
proved&mdash;still proves&mdash;impregnable; and the end
of the half-hour leaguer finds the intrenched one
secure in his position, with the enemy in permanent
check, and only his own waning strength to warn
him that the pass cannot be held indefinitely.</p>

<p>But this warning is imperative, as is that other
of the fast westering sun; and when a movement on
the opposite height gives him one more chance to
announce volley-wise that the pass is still manned,
he retreats swiftly, remounts after more than one
exhaustive effort, and canters down the farther windings
of the trail into a valley shut in on all sides by
snow-coifed sentinel mountains, and with a brawling
stream plunging through its midst; into this valley
and down the length of it to a narrowing of the
stream path, where a rude cabin, with its door
hanging awry, looks across from the heel of the
western cliff to the gray dump of a tunnel-opening
in the opposite mountain side.</p>

<p>The sun has already set for the lower slopes of
the shut-in valley, and the frosty breath of the snow-capped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
sentinel peaks is in the air. At the door of
the cabin the winner in the desperate race slides
from the saddle. His knees are quaking, and because
of them he stumbles and falls over the log
doorstone, cursing his helplessness in the jolt of it.
But there remains much to be done, and the sunset
glories are changing from crimson and dusky gold
on the snow-caps to royal purple in the shadow of
the western cliff.</p>

<p>With many slippings and stumblings he crosses
the foot-log and climbs to the level of the tunnel-opening
opposite, constraining the unwilling horse to
follow. With a stone for a hammer he tacks a
square of paper on one of the struts of the timbered
entrance; and after another struggle feebly fierce
the horse is dragged into the low-browed cavern and
tethered out of harm's way. By the leaden-footed
step of the man one would say that the last reserves
of determination have been called in and are
far spent; but he will not desist. With four stakes
taken from the heap of wooden treenails used in the
tunnel timbering he drags himself from corner to
corner of the claim, pacing its boundaries and marking
the points of intersection with dogged exactness.
When the final stake is driven he can no longer
stand upright, and is fain to win back to the tunnel
on hands and knees with groans and futile tooth-gnashings.</p>

<p>But the aftermath of the task still waits; shall
wait until he has barricaded the tunnel's mouth with
an up-piling of timbers, fragments of rock, odds and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
ends movable, with a counterscarp of loose earth to
make it bullet-proof&mdash;the last scraped up with
bleeding hands from the débris at the head of the
dump.</p>

<p>This done, he drags himself over the barricade,
finds the saddle-bags again, and strikes a light. The
candle flame is but a yellow puncture in the thick
gloom of the tunnel, but it serves his purpose, which
is to scrawl a few words on a blank page of an
engineer's note-book,&mdash;sole reminder of the thrifty
forecast of saner days beyond the descent into the
nether depths. An imprecation bubbles up to
punctuate the signature; a pointless cursing, which
is no more than a verbal mask for a groan extorted
by the agony of the effort to guide the pencil point.
The malison strings itself out into broken sentences
of justification; mere ravings, as pointless as the
curse. "Finders are keepers,&mdash;that's the law of
the strong. 'He that hath clean hands shall be
stronger and stronger.' I found it and gave it
back, and he drowned it in a bottle.... Now
it is mine; and to-morrow I'll be dead. But she'll
know that I haven't&mdash;that I haven't&mdash;quite&mdash;forgotten."</p>

<p>To pain-blurred eyes the candle flame has faded
to a nebulous point in the darkness, but still the
light suffices. He has neither envelope nor sealing-wax,
but he makes shift to seal the book with a
wrapping of twine and a bit of pitch scraped from
the nearest strut in the timbering. After which he
seeks and finds the crevice in which Garvin kept his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
explosives; and when the note-book is safely hidden,
drops exhausted behind the breastwork, with the
rifle at his shoulder, beginning his vigil what time
the first silvery flight of moon-arrows is pouring
upon cliff-face and cabin opposite.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a fact no less deprecable than true that
events in orderly sequence do not always lend themselves
to the purposes of a chronicler who would be
glad to prick in his climaxes with a pen borrowed
of the dramatist. With some little labor, and the
help of not a few coincidences which may fairly be
called fortuitous, the march of events in the life of
Henry Jeffard has led up to a point at which the
fictional unities pause, confidently anticipative of a
climax which shall reëcho the heroic struggle of the
Spartan few at Thermopylæ, or the daring-do of
the Pontine Horatius. But the facts are inexorable
and altogether disappointing. With prologue and
stage-setting for a Sophoclean tragedy, the piece
halts; hangs in the wind at the critical conjuncture
like a misstaying ship; becomes, in point of fact, a
mere modern comedy-drama with a touch of travesty
in it; and the unities, fictional and dramatic, shriek
and expire.</p>

<p>This humiliating failure of the dramatic possibilities
turns upon an inconsequent pivot-pin in the
human mechanism, namely, the lack of courage in
the last resort in men of low degree. To kidnap a
drunken man or to pistol an unarmed one is one
thing; to force a sky-pitched Gibraltar defended by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
a resolute fellow-being with a modern high-power
repeating rifle and an itching trigger-finger is quite
another. This was the conservative point of view
of the aliased ones; and after the final futile attempt
to gain the trail and the cover of the timber,
the twain held a council of war, vilified their luck,
and sounded a retreat.</p>

<p>Thus it came about that Denby and his man,
riding tantivy to the rescue, met the raiders two
miles down the trail Aspenward; and having this
eye-assurance that the foray had failed, the promoter
was minded to go back to town to await Jeffard's
return. But, having the eye-assurance, he was not
unwilling to add another. Bartrow's telegram had
named the figure of the assay; the incredible number
of dollars and cents to the ton to be sweated out
of the bonanza drift. Now assays are assays, but
investment is shy of them, demanding mill-runs,
and conservative estimates based on averages; and
pondering these things the rescuer reverted to his
normal character of capitalist in ordinary to moneyless
bonanzists, and determined to go on and see for
himself. Accordingly, Jeffard's unexpected reinforcements
pressed forward while the enemy was in
full tide of retreat; and a short half-hour later the
squadron of retrieval came near to paying the penalty
of an unheralded approach, since it was upon
the promoter and his henchman that Jeffard poured
his final volley.</p>

<p>So much for the tragi-comedy of the sky-pitched
Gibraltar, which made a travesty of Jeffard's heart-breaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
efforts to fortify himself in the old tunnel.
And as for the apparent determination to die open-eyed
and militant behind the barricade, the unromantic
truth again steps in to give the <i>coup de
grace</i> to the disappointed unities. There is a limit
to human endurance, and the hardiest soldier may
find it on a field as yet no more than half won.
Fastings and fierce hurryings, wounds, physical and
spiritual, and ruthless determination may ride roughshod
over Nature's turnpike; but Nature will demand
her toll. For this cause Jeffard saw no more
than the first flight of moon-arrows glancing from
the face of the western cliff. Long before the
Selenean archers were fairly warmed to their work
he had fallen asleep, with his cheek on the carved
grip of the borrowed rifle; a lost man to all intents
and purposes, if the fictional unities had not been
put to flight by the commonplace fact.</p>

<p>Behold him, then, awakening what time the volleying
sun has changed places with the moon-archers.
The barricaded tunnel has a dim twilight
of its own, but out and abroad the day is come, and
the keen air is tinnient with the fine treble of the
mountain morning. The slanting sun-fire spatters
the gray cliff opposite, and a spiral of blue smoke is
curling peacefully above the chimney of the cabin.
And in the shallows of the stream a man, who is
neither desperado black or red, is bathing the legs
of a horse. Under such conditions one may imagine
a recreant sentry rubbing his eyes to make sure, and
presently climbing the barricade to slide down the
dump into parley range, question-charged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>Denby unbent, smiling. "Didn't I say that you
were an inconsiderate madman? You had to sleep
or die."</p>

<p>"But when did you get here?"</p>

<p>"About the time the proxies would have arrived,
if you hadn't succeeded in discouraging them. It
was late; much later than it would have been if you
hadn't given us such an emphatic stand-off at the
summit. Come across and have some breakfast
with us."</p>

<p>Jeffard found the foot-log and made shift to walk
it.</p>

<p>"Did I fire at you? I thought it was another
charge coming. They had been trying to rush me."</p>

<p>"So I inferred. We camped down out of range
and gave you plenty of time. You may be no
marksman, but"&mdash;He finished the sentence in
dumb show by taking off his hat and pointing to a
bullet score in the crown of it. "A few inches
lower and you would have spoiled your first chance
of capitalizing the Midas. How do you feel this
morning?"</p>

<p>"A bit unresponsive, but better than I have a
right to expect. What became of the two raiders?"</p>

<p>"We met them riding a steeplechase toward
town. You discouraged them, as I said. From
Donald's count of the bullet-splashes on that bald
summit you must have gotten in your work pretty
lively."</p>

<p>Jeffard lowered the hammer of the rifle and
emptied the magazine. "It's a good weapon," he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
said. "I believe I could learn to shoot with it,
after a while. Will you sell it?"</p>

<p>"Not to any one. But I'll make you a present
of it. Let's go in and see what Donald has found
in his saddle-bags. It's a fine breakfast morning."</p>

<p>So they went into the cabin and sat at meat on
either side of a rough table of Garvin's contriving,
and were served by a solemn-faced Scot, whose skill
as a camp cook was commensurate with his ability
to hold his tongue. Notwithstanding the presumable
urgencies the breakfast talk was not of business.
Jeffard would have had it so, but Denby forbade.</p>

<p>"Not yet," he objected. "Not until you have
caught up with yourself. After breakfast Donald
will sling you a blanket hammock under the trees,
and you shall sleep the clock around. Then you'll
feel fit, and we can talk futures if you please."</p>

<p>If there were a prompting of suspicion in the
glance with which Jeffard met this proposal it remained
in abeyance. With every embrasure gunned
and manned the fortress of this life must always be
pregnable on the human side; in the last resort
one must trust something to the chance of loyalty in
the garrison. Wherefore Jeffard accepted the promoter's
pipe and the blanket hammock, and fell
asleep while Donald was pulling down the barricade
at the tunnel's mouth preparatory to liberating the
neighing horse stabled in the heading.</p>

<p>It was evening, just such another as that one
three months agone, in the heart of which two men
had sat at the cabin door looking a little into each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
other's past, when Jeffard opened his eyes. The
three horses, saddled, but with loose cinches, were
cropping the sun-cured grass on the level which
served as a dooryard for the cabin; and an appetizing
smell of frying bacon was abroad in the air.
Jeffard sat up yawning, and the promoter rose from
the doorstep and rapped the ashes from his pipe.</p>

<p>"Feel better?" he queried.</p>

<p>"I feel like a new man. I hadn't realized that
I was so nearly spent."</p>

<p>"That is why I prescribed the blanket. Another
day would have finished you."</p>

<p>Jeffard slid out of the hammock and went to
plunge his face and hands in the stream; after
which they ate again as men who postpone the lesser
to the greater; with Donald the taciturn serving
them, and hunger waiving speech and ceremony.</p>

<p>It was yet no more than twilight when the meal
was finished; and Denby found a candle and
matches in the henchman's saddlebags.</p>

<p>"If you are ready, we'll go up to the tunnel and
have another look at the lead before we go," he
said. "I have been examining it to-day, and I'll
make you a proposition on the ground, if you like."</p>

<p>Jeffard pieced out the inference with the recollection
of the saddled horses.</p>

<p>"Do we go back to-night?"</p>

<p>"Yes; if you are good for it. It has been a
pretty warm day for the season, and we are like to
have more of them. There is a good bit of snow
on the trail, and if it softens we shall be shut in.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
That's one reason, and another is this: if we make
a deal and mean to get any machinery in here before
snow flies and the range is blocked, we've got to be
about it."</p>

<p>Jeffard nodded acquiescence, and they fared forth
to cross the foot-log and toil up the shelving slope
of the gray dump. It was a stiff climb for a whole
man, and at the summit Jeffard sat down with his
hands to his head and his teeth agrind.</p>

<p>"By Jove! but that sets it in motion again in
good shape!" he groaned. "Sit down here and
let's talk it out in the open. I don't care to burrow."</p>

<p>Denby pocketed his candle, and they sat together
on the brink of the dump, with their backs to the
opening; and thus it chanced that neither of them
saw a shadowy figure skulking among the firs beside
the tunnel's mouth. When they began to talk the
figure edged nearer, flitting ghostlike from tree to
tree, and finally crouching under the penthouse of
the tunnel timbering.</p>

<p>The crimson and mauve had faded out of the
western sky when the two at the dump-head rose,
and Jeffard said: "Your alternative is fair enough.
It's accepted, without conditions other than this&mdash;that
you will advance me a few hundred dollars for
my own purposes some time within thirty days."</p>

<p>"You needn't make that a condition; I should
be glad to tide you over in any event. But I am
sorry you won't let me buy in. As I have said,
there is enough here for both of us."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>The aftermath of the getting up was a sharp
agony, and Jeffard had his hands to his head again.
When he answered it was to say:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I sha'n't sell. There are reasons, and you may
take this for the lack of a better. A while back,
when a single meal in the day was sometimes beyond
me, I used to say that if the tide should ever turn
I'd let the money go on piling up and up until there
was no possibility of hunger in an eternity of futures.
You say the tide has turned."</p>

<p>"It has, for a fact; and I don't know that I
blame you. If it were mine I should probably try
to keep it whole."</p>

<p>Jeffard went on as one who follows out his own
train of thought regardless of answers relevant or
impertinent. "I said that, and I don't know that I
have changed my mind. But before we strike hands
on the bargain it may be as well to go back to the
question which you were good enough to leave in
abeyance yesterday."</p>

<p>"The question of ethics?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I am going to take something for granted, if
you don't choose to be frank with me."</p>

<p>"It will be safer to take nothing for granted."</p>

<p>"But the claim is yours?"</p>

<p>"Legally, yes; there will be no litigation."</p>

<p>"But honestly, as man to man." Denby put his
hands on the wounded man's shoulders, and turned
him about so that the fading light in the west fell
upon his face. "My dear fellow, I've known you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
but a day, but your face isn't the face of a scoundrel.
I can't believe that the man who made the
magnificent fight that you did would make it to
overreach his partner."</p>

<p>Jeffard turned aside, with a backward step that
freed him from the friendly hands. Twice he tried
to speak, and at the third attempt the words came
but haltingly.</p>

<p>"It will be better in the end&mdash;better for all concerned&mdash;if
you&mdash;if you do believe it. Believe it,
and cause it to be believed, if you choose. I have
counted the cost, and am ready to take the consequences."</p>

<p>Denby thrust his hands into his pockets and began
to tramp, three paces and a turn, across and
across the narrow embankment. A little light was
beginning to sift in between the man and his mystery,
but it was not of the sun.</p>

<p>"Mr. Jeffard, I'd like to ask a question. You
needn't answer it if you don't want to. Do you
know who drove this tunnel?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"Was it the man who raced you from Leadville
to Aspen, and who shot you when you tried to bluff
him by making him believe that you had already
located the claim in your own name?"</p>

<p>"It was."</p>

<p>"Then, to put it plainly, you are the aggressor,
after all. You have really jumped your partner's
claim."</p>

<p>The promoter stopped and faced his man, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
skulker at the tunnel's mouth crept nearer, as a
listener who may not miss a word.</p>

<p>"That is what men will say, I suppose; and I
shall not contradict them. He has forfeited his
right." Jeffard said it with eyes downcast, but
there was no incertitude in the words.</p>

<p>"Forfeited his right? How? By shooting at
you in a very natural fit of frenzied rage? I can't
believe that you realize the enormity of this thing,
Mr. Jeffard. You are new to the West. It is true
that the law can't touch you, but public opinion, the
sentiment of a mining region, will brand you as the
basest of thieves."</p>

<p>"That is the public's privilege. I shall not
attempt to defend myself&mdash;to you, or to any one.
The consequences are mine to suffer or to ignore."</p>

<p>"You can't ignore them. Your best friends will
turn upon you, and mining-camp justice will not
only acquit the man who tried to kill you&mdash;it will
fight for him and condemn you."</p>

<p>"But yesterday you said it would have given me
the benefit of the doubt and lynched him. I can
fight my own battle."</p>

<p>"Yes, I did say so; and, lacking your own evidence
against yourself, it will condemn him yet.
Had you thought of that?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Denby, I have answered your questions because
you had a right to ask them. To the public I
shall neither deny nor affirm."</p>

<p>"Then you'll have the choice of posing as a
scoundrel on the one hand, or of consenting to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
death or imprisonment of a measurably innocent
man on the other. I don't envy you."</p>

<p>"It is my own affair, as you were good enough to
say yesterday. Do you wish to withdraw your proposal?"</p>

<p>Denby took time to think about it, pacing out his
decision what time the moon was beginning to silver
the western snow-caps.</p>

<p>"No; as I have made it and you have accepted it,
the proposal is merely a matter of service to be rendered
and paid for; I furnish the capital to work
the mine for a year for a certain portion of the output.
But if you had taken me up on the original
proposition, I should beg to be excused. Under the
circumstances, I shouldn't care to be a joint owner
with you."</p>

<p>"You couldn't be," said Jeffard briefly; "you,
nor any one else."</p>

<p>"Well, we are agreed as to that. Shall we go
now? Donald is waiting, and the moon will be up
by the time we strike the trail."</p>

<p>"One moment; I have left something in the
tunnel."</p>

<p>Jeffard turned back toward the timbered archway,
and the promoter went with him. In the act a
shadowy figure darted into the mouth of gloom and
was seen by Denby.</p>

<p>"What was that?"</p>

<p>"I didn't see anything."</p>

<p>Denby stumbled over the remains of the barricade.
"That must have been what I saw," he said. "But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
at the moment I could have sworn it was a man
dodging into the tunnel."</p>

<p>A few feet from the entrance Jeffard felt along
the wall for the crevice, found it, and presently
thrust the note-book into Denby's hands.</p>

<p>"You may remember that I told you I should
leave my will here against a contingency which
seemed altogether probable. In view of what has
since passed between us, I sha'n't hold you to your
promise to act as my executor; but if anything
happens to me I shall be glad if you will send that
book under seal to Dick Bartrow. You will do that
much for me, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"That is all; now I am at your service."</p>

<p>A few minutes later the cabin and the bit of
dry sward in front of it were deserted, and the whispering
firs had swallowed up the last faint echoes of
minishing hoof-beats. Not until the silence was unbroken
did the shadowy figure venture out of its
hiding in the tunnel to stumble blindly down the
dump, across the foot-log, and so to the cabin door.
Here it went down on hands and knees to quarter
the ground like a hungry animal in search of food.
Unhappily, the simile is no simile. It was James
Garvin, who, for the better part of two days, had
not tasted food. And when finally the patient
search was rewarded by the retrieval of a few scraps
of bacon and pan-bread, the broken meats of Donald's
supper-table, the starving fugitive fell upon
them with a beastlike growl of triumph. But in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
midst of the scanty feast he dropped the bread and
meat to cover his face with his hands, rocking back
and forth in his misery and sobbing like a child.</p>

<p>"Oh, my Gawd!&mdash;ef I hadn't hearn it out'n
his own mouth ... and me a-lovin' him thess like
he'd been blood-kin to me! Oh, my Gawd!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was rather late in the autumn, too late to admit
of a rush of prospectors to the shut-in valley, when
the fame of the new gold-bearing district in the Elk
Mountains began to be noised about. As bonanza
fame is like to be, the earlier bruitings of it were as
nebulous as the later and more detailed accounts
were fabulous. Some garbled story of the fight for
possession found its way into the newspapers; and
since this had its starting-point in the resentment
of the Aspen newsgatherer who had been so curtly
sent to the right-about by Jeffard, it became the
basis of an accusation, which was scathing and fearless,
or covert and retractable, in just proportion to
the obsequiousness of the journalistic accusers.</p>

<p>In its most favorable rendering this story was an
ugly one; but here again chance, in the form of
reportorial inaccuracy, was kind to Jeffard. From
his boyhood people had been stumbling over his
name; and with ample facilities for verifying the
spelling of it the reporters began, continued, and
ended by making it "Jeffers," "Jeffreys," and in one
instance even "Jefferson." Hence, with Bartrow
as the single exception, no one who knew Jeffard
identified him with the man who had figured as the
putative villain-hero in the fight for possession.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>Bartrow read the account of the race, the shooting
affray, and the subsequent details of the capitalizing
of the Midas, with Denby as its promoter and Jeffard
as sole owner, with judgment suspended. It
was not in him to condemn any man unheard; and
Jeffard had put himself safely out of reach of queryings,
friendly or otherwise, by burying himself for
the winter with the development force which the
promoter had hurried across the range before the
snows isolated the shut-in valley. Later, when he
had to pay the note in the Leadville bank, Bartrow
had a twinge of dismay; but again invincible fairness
came to the rescue, and he lifted the dishonored
paper at a time when he could ill afford to, promising
himself that this, too, should be held in solution;
should not even be precipitated in confidence with
any one.</p>

<p>This promise he kept until Constance Elliott
plumbed the depths of him, as she was prone to do
when he gave evidence of having anything to conceal.
The occasion was the midwinter ball of the
First Families of Colorado; and having more than
one score to settle with the young miner, who had
lately been conspicuous only by his absence, Connie
had arbitrarily revised Bartrow's programme,&mdash;which
contemplated a monopoly of all the dances
Miss Van Vetter would give him.</p>

<p>"Well, catalogue 'em&mdash;what have I done?"
demanded the unabashed one, when she had marched
him into that particular alcove of the great hotel
dining-room which did temporary duty as a conservatory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>"Several things." Stephen Elliott's daughter was
in the mood called pertness in disagreeable young
women. "Have you quite forgotten that I stand
<i>in loco parentis</i> to the giddy and irresponsible young
person whose card you have covered with your scrawly
autographs?"</p>

<p>The idea was immensely entertaining to the young
miner, who laughed so heartily that a sentimental
couple billing and cooing behind the fan-palms took
wing immediately. "You? you chaperoning Myr&mdash;Miss
Van Vetter? That's a good one!"</p>

<p>"It's a bad one, where you are concerned. What
do you mean by such an inconsistent breach of the
proprieties?"</p>

<p>"Inconsistent? I'm afraid I don't quite catch
on."</p>

<p>"Yes, inconsistent. You bury yourself for
months on end in that powder-smelly old tunnel of
yours, and about the time we've comfortably forgotten
you, you straggle in with a dress-coat on your
arm and proceed to monopolize one of us. What
do you take us for?"</p>

<p>It was on the tip of Bartrow's tongue to retort
that he would very much like to take Miss Van
Vetter for better or worse, but he had not the courage
of his convictions. So he kept well in the
middle of the road, and made the smoke-blackened
tunnel his excuse for the inconsistency.</p>

<p>"It isn't 'months,' Connie; or at least it's only
two of them. You know I'd be glad enough to
chase myself into Denver every other day if I could.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
But it is coming down to brass tacks with us in the
Little Myriad, and I've just got to keep my eye on
the gun."</p>

<p>Whereupon pertness, or the Constance Elliott
transmutation of it, vanished, and she made him sit
down.</p>

<p>"Tell me all about the Little Myriad, Dick. Is
it going to keep its promise?"</p>

<p>The Little Myriad's owner sought and found a
handkerchief, using it mopwise. Curious questions
touching the prospects of his venture on Topeka
Mountain were beginning to have a perspiratory
effect upon him.</p>

<p>"I wish I could know for sure, Connie. Sometimes
I think it will; and some other times I should
think it means to go back on me,&mdash;if I dared to."</p>

<p>"Isn't the lead still well-defined?" Constance
dropped into the mining technicalities with the easy
familiarity of one born in the metalliferous West.</p>

<p>"It is now; but two months ago, or thereabouts,
it pinched out entirely. That is why I hibernated."</p>

<p>"Was the last mill-run encouraging?"</p>

<p>"N-no, I can't say that it was. The ore&mdash;what
little there is of it&mdash;seems to grade rather lower as
we go in. But it's a true fissure, and it must begin
to go the other way when we get deep enough."</p>

<p>For a half-score of fan-sweeps Connie was silent.
Then: "Is the purse growing light, Dickie? Because
if it is, poppa's is still comfortably fat."</p>

<p>Bartrow laughed in a way to indicate that the
strain was lessened for the moment. "I believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
you and your father would give away the last dollar
you have in the world. But it hasn't come to a
fresh loan with me yet."</p>

<p>"When it does, you know where to float it."</p>

<p>"When it does, I sha'n't rob my best friends.
If I have to borrow more money for development,
I'm afraid the loan will be classed as 'extra hazardous.'
But you said there were several things.
What else have I done?"</p>

<p>"The next is something you haven't done. You
haven't written a line to Mr. Lansdale in all these
weeks,&mdash;not even to thank him for taking your
foolish telegram about the Margaret Gannon crisis
seriously. And he tells me he has written you
twice."</p>

<p>"I'm a miserable sinner, and letter writing isn't
in me. Is Lansdale here? I'll go and square
myself in the most abject formula you can suggest."</p>

<p>"He isn't here. He is out at Bennett on a ranch."</p>

<p>"On a ranch in midwinter? Who on top of
earth told him to do that?"</p>

<p>"One of the doctors. I wanted to dissuade him,
but I hadn't the heart to try. He is so anxious to
live."</p>

<p>"Naturally." Bartrow eyed his companion in a
way which was meant to be a measure of the things
he knew and would by no means tell, but Constance
was opening and shutting her fan with inthought
paramount, and saw it not. Whereat Bartrow was
brutal enough to say: "Is he going to make a go
of it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I hope so, Dick! It is such a pathetic
struggle. And he is like all the others who are best
worth keeping alive: he won't let any one help him.
Just fancy him working for his board on a dreary
prairie ranch! The monotony of it is enough to kill
him."</p>

<p>"I should say so. Lamb ranch, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then I can imagine the hilarity of it. Up at
all sorts of hours and in all weathers feeding and
watering. That isn't what he needs. A wagon
trip in summer, with good company, lots of outdoors,
and nothing to do but eat and sleep, would
be more like it. If he pulls through to spring, and
the Myriad will let up on me for a month or two, I
don't know but I shall be tempted to make him try
it."</p>

<p>"Oh, Dick! would you?" There was a quick
upflash of wistful emotion in the calm gray eyes.
Bartrow set it down to a fresh growth in perspicacity
on his own part that he was able to interpret
it&mdash;or thought he was. But the little upflash went
out like a taper in the dark with the added afterthought.
"It's no use, Dick. The Myriad won't
let you."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it will; though I'm bound to admit
that it doesn't look that way at present. Now, if
Jef&mdash;"</p>

<p>From what has gone before it will be understood
that any mention of Jeffard for good or ill was the
one thing which Bartrow had promised himself to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
avoid at all hazards; wherefore he broke the name
in the midst, coughed, dragged out his watch,&mdash;in
short, did what manlike untactfulness may do to
create a diversion, and at the end of it found the
unafraid eyes fixed upon him with mandatory orders
in them.</p>

<p>"Go on," she said calmly. "If Mr. Jeffard"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Really, Connie, I must break it off short; my
time's up. Don't you hear the orchestra? Miss
Van Vetter will"&mdash;</p>

<p>But Connie was not to be turned aside by any
consideration for Bartrow's engagements or her own;
nor yet by the inflow into the alcove-conservatory of
sundry other fanning couples lately freed from the
hop-and-slide of the two-step. Nor yet again by the
appearance of young Mr. Theodore Calmaine, who
came up behind Bartrow and was straightway transfixed
and driven forth with pantomimic cut and
thrust.</p>

<p>"Myra will have no difficulty in finding a partner.
Don't be foolish, Dick. I have known all
along that you have learned something about Mr.
Jeffard which you wouldn't tell me. You may
remember that you have persistently ignored my
questions in your answers to my letters,&mdash;and I paid
you back by telling you little or nothing about
Myra. Now what were you going to say?"</p>

<p>"I was going to say that if Jeffard were like what
he used to be, he would do for Lansdale what I
shall probably not be able to do."</p>

<p>"What do you know about Mr. Jeffard?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>"What all the world knows&mdash;and a little more.
Of course you have read what the newspapers had
to say?"</p>

<p>"I have never seen a mention of his name."</p>

<p>"Why, you must have; they were full of it a
month or two ago, and will be again as soon as the
range opens and we find out what the big bonanza
has been doing through the winter. You don't
mean to say that you didn't read about the free-gold
strike in the Elk Mountains, and the locomotive
race, and the shooting scrape in the hotel at
Aspen, and all that?"</p>

<p>The steady eyes were veiled and Connie's breath
came in nervous little gasps. Any man save downright
Richard Bartrow would have made a swift
diversion, were it only to an open window or back
to the ballroom. But he sat stocklike and silent,
letting her win through the speechlessness of it to
the faltered reply.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I saw it; yes. But the name of that man
was&mdash;was not Jeffard."</p>

<p>"No, it was Jeffers, or anything that came handy
in the newspaper accounts. But that was a reporter's
mistake."</p>

<p>"Dick,"&mdash;the steadfast eyes were transfixing
him again,&mdash;"are you quite sure of that?"</p>

<p>"I ought to be. I was the man who helped him
out at the pinch and got him started on the locomotive
chase."</p>

<p>"You helped him?&mdash;then all those things they
said about him were true?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>It was Bartrow's turn to hesitate. "I&mdash;I'm
trying not to believe that, Connie."</p>

<p>"But you know the facts; or at least, more of
them than the newspapers told. Did the claim
really belong to him, or to James Garvin?"</p>

<p>Bartrow crossed his legs, uncrossed them, and
again had recourse to his watch.</p>

<p>"I wish you'd leave the whole business up in the
air, Connie, the way I'm trying to. It doesn't
seem quite fair, somehow, to condemn him behind
his back."</p>

<p>"But the facts," she insisted. "You know them,
don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and they're against him." Bartrow confessed
it in sheer desperation. "The claim was
Garvin's; Jeffard not only admitted it, but he
started out on the chase with the declared determination
of standing between Garvin and those two
blacklegs who were trying to plunder him. That's
all; that's as far as my facts go. Beyond that you&mdash;and
the newspapers&mdash;know as much as I do."</p>

<p>"Not quite all, Dick. You say you helped him;
that means that you lent him money, or borrowed it
for him. Did he ever pay it back?"</p>

<p>Bartrow got upon his feet at that and glowered
down upon her with mingled chagrin and awe in
gaze and answer.</p>

<p>"Say, Connie, you come precious near to being
uncanny at times, don't you know it? That was
the one thing I didn't mean to tell any one. Yes,
I borrowed for him; and no, he didn't pay it back.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
That's all&mdash;all of the all. If you put me in a
stamp-mill you couldn't pound out anything else.
Now, for pity's sake, let me get back to Miss Van
Vetter before I fall in with the notion that I'm too
transparent to be visible to the naked eye."</p>

<p>She rose and took his arm.</p>

<p>"You're good, Dickie," she said softly; "much
too good for this world. I'm sorry for you, because
it earns you so many buffetings."</p>

<p>"And you think I'm in for another on Jeffard's
account."</p>

<p>"I am sure you are&mdash;now. The last time I saw
him he wore a mask; a horrible mask of willful
degradation and cynicism and self-loathing; but I
saw behind it."</p>

<p>They were making a slow circuit of the ballroom
in search of Connie's cousin, and the throng and the
music isolated them.</p>

<p>"What did you see?"</p>

<p>"I saw the making of a strong man; strong for
good or for evil; a man who could compel the world-attitudes
that most of us have to sue for, or who
would be strong enough on the evil side to flout and
ignore them. I thought then that he was at the parting
of the ways, but it seems I was mistaken,&mdash;that
the real balancing moment came with what poppa
calls the 'high-mountain bribe,'&mdash;Satan's offer of
the kingdoms of this world and the glory of them."</p>

<p>Now, a thronged ballroom is scarcely a fit place
for heart-to-heart outreachings; but there be loyal
hearts who are not constrained by their encompassments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
and Bartrow was of that brotherhood. They
had attained a corner where one might swing a
short-sword without fear of beheading the nearest
of the dancers or out-sitters, and he faced about and
took both of Connie's hands in his.</p>

<p>"Do you know, little sister, I'm awfully glad
you're able to talk that way about him. There was
a time when I began to be afraid&mdash;for your sake
first, and afterward for"&mdash;</p>

<p>It is conceivable that the frankest of young women
may have some reserves of time and place, if not of
subjects, and before honest Dick could finish, Constance
had freed herself and was reproaching young
Calmaine for not seeking her out for the dance in
process,&mdash;which was his.</p>

<p>Teddy's apology had in it the flavor of long acquaintance
and the insolence thereof. "You're a
cool one," he said, when they had left Bartrow behind.
"As if I didn't stand for five good minutes at the
door of that conservatory place, with you eye-pistoling
and daggering me to make me go away!"</p>

<p>Thinking about it afterward, Bartrow wondered
a little that Connie seemed bent on ignoring him
through the remainder of the functional hours, large
and small, but so it was. And when finally he was
constrained to put Miss Van Vetter in the carriage,
Connie's good-night and good-by were of the briefest.
Miss Van Vetter, too, was silent on the homeward
drive, and this Connie remarked, charging it
openly to Dick's account when they were before the
fire in Myra's room contemplating the necessity of
going to bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, Mr. Bartrow was all that the most exacting
person could demand,&mdash;and more," said Miss Van
Vetter, going to the mirror to begin the relaxing
process. "It was something he told me."</p>

<p>"About Mr. Jeffard?"</p>

<p>"Yes; how did you know?"</p>

<p>"I didn't know&mdash;I guessed."</p>

<p>"Isn't it dreadful!"</p>

<p>"No. Some of the other things he did might
have been that; but this is unspeakable."</p>

<p>Myra turned her back upon the mirror and came
to stand behind Connie's chair with her arms about
her cousin's neck.</p>

<p>"Connie, dear, do you know that one time I was
almost afraid that you,&mdash;but now I am glad,&mdash;glad
that your point of view is&mdash;is quite extrinsic,
you know."</p>

<p>Connie's gaze was upon the fire in the grate,
fresh-stirred and glowing, a circumstance which may
have accounted for the sudden trembling of the eyelids
and the upwelling of tears in the steadfast eyes.
And as for the nervous little quaver in her voice,
there was fatigue to answer for that.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I'm so glad you all take that for granted,"
she said. "I don't know what I should do if you
didn't."</p>

<p>And a little later Myra went to bed and to sleep,
wondering if, after all, there were not secret places
in the heart of her transparent kinswoman which
evaded the search-warrant of cousinly disinterest.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> obsequious waiter had cleared the table and
brought in the dessert, and was hovering in the
middle distance with two cigars in a whiskey glass.
The persiflant young people at the other end of the
table rose and went away, leaving a grateful silence
behind them; and the clerical gentleman at Lansdale's
right folded his napkin in absent-minded
deference to home habit, and slipped sidewise out of
his chair as if reluctant to mar the new-born hush.</p>

<p>Bartrow was down from the mine on the ostensible
business of restocking the commissariat department
of the Little Myriad,&mdash;a business which, prior to
Miss Van Vetter's Denver year, had transacted
itself indifferently well by letter,&mdash;and Lansdale
was dining with him at the hotel by hospitable appointment.
There were months between this and
their last meeting, an entire winter, in point of fact;
but it is one of the compensations of man-to-man
friendships that they ignore absences and bridge
intervals smoothly, uncoupling and upcoupling again
with small jar of accountings for the incidents of
the lacuna.</p>

<p>Because of the persiflant young people, the fire of
query and rejoinder had been the merest shelling
of the woods on either side; but with the advent of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
quiet Bartrow said: "Your winter on the lamb-ranch
didn't do you much good, did it?"</p>

<p>"Think not?" Lansdale looked up quickly,
with a pathetic plea for heartening in the deep-set
eyes of him. "I was hoping you'd say it had. I
feel stronger&mdash;at times."</p>

<p>Bartrow saw the plea and the pathos of it, and
added one more to the innumerable contemnings of
his own maladroitness. He was quite sure of his
postulate, however,&mdash;as sure as he was of the unnecessary
cruelty of setting it in words. Lansdale
was visibly failing. The clean-shaven face was thin
to gauntness, and the dark eyes were unnaturally
bright and wistful. Bartrow bribed the ubiquitous
waiter to remove himself, making the incident an
excuse for changing the subject.</p>

<p>"Never saw or heard anything more of Jeffard,
did you?" he said, pitching the conversational quoit
toward a known peg of common interest, and taking
it for granted that Lansdale, like Connie, had not
read the proletary's name into the newspaper misspellings.</p>

<p>"Not a thing. And I have often wondered what
happened."</p>

<p>"Then Connie hasn't told you?"</p>

<p>"Miss Elliott? No; I didn't know she knew
him."</p>

<p>"She met him a time or two; which is another
way of saying that she knows him better than we
do. She's a whole assay outfit when it comes to
sizing people up."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>"What was her opinion of Jeffard?" Lansdale
was curious to know if it confirmed his own.</p>

<p>"Oh, she thinks he is a grand rascal, of course,&mdash;as
everybody does."</p>

<p>"Naturally," said Lansdale, having in mind the
proletary's later reincarnations as vagrant and starveling.
"You didn't see much of him after he got
fairly into the toboggan and on the steeper grades,
did you?"</p>

<p>"Here in Denver?&mdash;no. But what I did see
was enough to show that he was pretty badly tiger-bitten.
You told me afterward that he took the
post-graduate course in his particular specialty."</p>

<p>"He did; sunk his shaft, as you mining folk
would say, straight on down to the chaotic substrata;
pawned himself piecemeal to feed the animals, and
went hungry between times by way of contrast."</p>

<p>"Poor devil!" said Bartrow, speaking in the
past tense.</p>

<p>"Yes, in all conscience; but not so much for
what he suffered as for what he was."</p>

<p>The distinction was a little abstruse for a man
whose nayword was obviousness, but for the better
part of a year Bartrow had been borrowing of Miss
Van Vetter; among other things some transplantings
of subtlety.</p>

<p>"That's where we come apart," he objected, with
amiable obstinacy. "You think the root of the
thing is in the man,&mdash;has been in him all along,
and only waiting for a chance to sprout. Now I
don't. I think it's in the atmosphere; in the&mdash;the"&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>"Environment?" suggested Lansdale.</p>

<p>"Yes, I guess that's the word; something outside
of the man; something that he didn't make,
and isn't altogether to blame for, and can't always
control."</p>

<p>The man with a moiety of the seer's gift suffered
his eyebrows to arch query-wise. "Doesn't that
ask for a remodeling of the accepted theory of good
and evil?"</p>

<p>"No, you don't!" laughed Bartrow. "You are
not going to pull me in over my head, if I know it.
But I'll wrestle with you from now till midnight on
my own ground. You take the best fellow in the
world, brought up on good wholesome bread and
meat and the like, and stop his rations for awhile.
Then, when he is hungry enough, you give him a
rag to chew, and he'll proceed to chew it,&mdash;not
necessarily because he likes the taste of the rag, or
because he was born with the rag-chewing appetite,
but simply for the reason that you have put it in
his mouth, and, being hungry, he's got to chew
something. Jeffard is a case in point."</p>

<p>"Let us leave Jeffard and the personal point
of view out of the question and stand it upon its
own feet," rejoined Lansdale, warming to the fray.
"Doubtless Jeffard's problem is divisible by the
common human factor, whatever that may be, but
your theory makes it too easy for the evil-doer.
Consequently I can't admit it,&mdash;not even in Jeffard's
case."</p>

<p>"I could make you admit it," retorted Bartrow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
with generous warmth, forgetting the dishonored
note in the Leadville bank, and remembering only
the year agone partnership in brother-keeping.
"You can size people up ten times to my once,&mdash;you
ought to; it's right in your line,&mdash;but I know
Jeffard worlds better than you do, and I could tell
you things about him that would make you weep.
Since he did those things I've had a rattling good
chance to change my mind about him, but I'm not
going to do it till I have to. I'm going to keep on
believing that away down deep under this devil's-drift
of&mdash;what was it you called it?&mdash;environment,
there's a streak of good clean ore. It may take the
stamp-mill or the smelter to get it out, but it's there
all the same. He may fall down on you and me
and all of his friends at any one of a dozen pinches,&mdash;he
has fallen down on me, and pretty middling
hard, too,&mdash;but there will come a pinch sometime
that will pull him up short, and then you'll see
what is in the lower levels of him,&mdash;what was there
all the time, waiting for somebody to sink a shaft
deep enough to tap it."</p>

<p>Lansdale took the cigar Bartrow was proffering
and clipped the end of it, reflectively deliberate.
He was silent so long that Bartrow said: "Well?
you don't believe it, eh?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't say that," Lansdale rejoined abstractedly;
"anyway, not of Jeffard. Perhaps you
are right. He has given me the same impression at
times, but he was always saying or doing something
immediately afterward to obliterate it. But I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
wondering why you prophesy so confidently about a
man who, for aught we know, took himself out of
the world the better part of a year ago."</p>

<p>"Suicided?&mdash;not much! He's alive all right;
very much alive and very much on top, as far as
money is concerned. You don't read the papers, I
take it?"</p>

<p>Lansdale's smile was of weariness. "Being at
present a reporter on one of them I read them as
little as may be. What should I have read that I
didn't?"</p>

<p>"To begin back a piece, you should have read last
fall about the big free-gold strike in the Elk Mountains,
and an exciting little scrap between two men
to get the first location on it."</p>

<p>"I remember that."</p>

<p>"Well, one of the men&mdash;the successful one&mdash;was
Jeffard; our Jeffard. Your newspaper accomplices
didn't spell his name right,&mdash;won't spell it
right yet,&mdash;but it's Henry Jeffard, and yesterday's
'Coloradoan' says he's on his way to Denver to
play leading man in the bonanza show."</p>

<p>Lansdale went silent what time it took to splice
out the past with the present. After which he said:
"I understand now why Miss Elliott condemns him,
but not quite clearly why you defend him. As I
remember it, the man who got possession of the
Midas posed as a highwayman of the sort that the
law can't punish. What has he to say for himself?"</p>

<p>Bartrow shook his head. "I don't know. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
haven't seen him since one day last fall; the day of
the locomotive chase."</p>

<p>"Did you know then that he was going to steal
his partner's mine?"</p>

<p>"No. I thought then that he was going to do
the other thing. And I'll not believe yet that he
hasn't done the other thing. It's the finish I'm
betting on. He may have flown the track at all the
turns,&mdash;at this last turn as well as the others,&mdash;but
when it comes to the home stretch, you watch
him put his shoulder into the collar and remember
what I said. I hope we'll both be there to see."</p>

<p>"So be it," Lansdale acquiesced. "It isn't in
me to smash any man's ideal. And if anything
could make me have faith in my kind, I think your
belief in the inherent virtue of the race would work
the miracle."</p>

<p>Bartrow laughed again, and pushed back his
chair.</p>

<p>"It does you a whole lot of good to play at being
a cold-blooded man-hater, doesn't it? But it's no
go. Your practice doesn't gee with your preaching.
Let's go out on the porch and smoke, if it won't be
too cool for you."</p>

<p>They left the dining-room together and strolled out
through the crowded lobby, lighting their cigars at the
news-stand in passing. There was a convention of
some sort in progress, and a sprinkling of the delegates,
with red silk badges displayed, was scattered
among the chairs on the veranda. Bartrow found
two chairs a little apart from the decorated ones,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
faced them, and tilted his own against the railing.
When his cigar was well alight he bethought him of
a neglected duty.</p>

<p>"By the way, old man, I've never had the grace
to say 'much obliged' for your neatness and dispatch
in carrying out my wire order. I suppose you've
forgotten it months ago, but I haven't. It was
good of you. Connie wrote me about it at the time,
and she said a whole lot of pretty things about the
way you climbed into the breach."</p>

<p>"Did she?" Lansdale's habitual reserve fell away
from him like a cast garment, and if Bartrow had
been less oblivious to face readings he might have
seen that which would have made his heart ache.
But he saw nothing and went on, following his own
lead.</p>

<p>"Yes; she said you took hold like a good fellow,
and hung on like a dog to a root,&mdash;that is, she
didn't say that, of course, but that was the sense of
it. I'm obliged, a whole lot."</p>

<p>"You needn't be. The obligation is on my side.
It was a pleasure to try to help Miss Elliott, even if
I wasn't able to accomplish anything worth mentioning."</p>

<p>"Yes. She's good people; there's no discount
on that. But say, you didn't size up Pete Grim
any better than you had to. A good stiff bluff is
about the only thing he can appreciate."</p>

<p>"If you had heard me talk to him you would have
admitted that I was trying to bluff him the best I
knew how," said Lansdale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>Bartrow laughed unfeelingly. "Tried to scare
him with a lawsuit, didn't you? What do you suppose
a man like Grim cares for the law? Why, bless
your innocent soul, he can buy all the law he needs
six days in the week and get it gratis on the seventh.
But you might have fetched him down with a gun."</p>

<p>Lansdale tried to imagine himself attempting such
a thing and failed. "I'm afraid I couldn't have
done that&mdash;successfully. It asks for a little practice,
doesn't it? and from what I have learned of
Mr. Peter Grim in my small dealings with him, I
fancy he wouldn't make a very tractable lay-figure
for a beginner to experiment on. But we worried
the thing through after a fashion, and recovered the
young woman's sewing-machine finally."</p>

<p>"Bought Grim off, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"That was what it amounted to. Miss Elliott's
father came to the rescue."</p>

<p>"There's a man for you!" declared Bartrow.
"Built from the ground up, and white all the way
through. And Connie's just like him. She's first
cousin to the angels when she isn't making game of
you. But I suppose you don't need to have anybody
sing her praises to you at this late day."</p>

<p>"No; that is why I say the obligation is on my
side. I am indebted to your 'wire order' for more
things than I could well catalogue."</p>

<p>Bartrow rocked gently on the hinder legs of his
chair, assuring himself that one of the things needed
not to be listed. After which he became diplomatically
abstruse on his own account. Two of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
decorated ones came by, promenading arm in arm,
and he waited until they were out of hearing.</p>

<p>"Found them good people to know, didn't you?
<i>Bueno!</i> You used to hibernate a heap too much."
Then, with labored indifference: "What do you
think of Miss Van Vetter?"</p>

<p>Lansdale laughed.</p>

<p>"Whatever you would like to have me think, my
dear boy. Shall I say that she is the quintessence
of all the virtuous graces and the graceful virtues?&mdash;a
paragon of para&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, come off!" growled the abstruse one.
"You've been taking lessons of Connie. You know
what I mean. Do I&mdash;that is&mdash;er&mdash;do you think
I stand a ghost of a show there? Honest, now."</p>

<p>"My dear Richard, if I could look into the heart
of a young woman and read what is therein written,
I could pass poverty in the street with a nod contemptuous.
I'd be a made man."</p>

<p>"Oh, you be hanged, will you? You're a wild
ass of the lamb-ranches, and wisdom has shook you,"
Bartrow rejoined, relapsing into vituperation. "Why
can't you quit braying for a minute or so and be
serious? It's a serious world, for the bigger part."</p>

<p>"Do you find it so? with a Miss Van Vetter for
an eye-piece to your telescope? I am astonished."</p>

<p>Bartrow pulled his hat over his eyes and enveloped
himself in a cloud of smoke. "When you're ready
to fold up your ears and be human people again, just
let me know, will you?" This from the midst of
the smoke-cloud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't sulk, my Achilles; you shall have your
Briseis,&mdash;if you can get her," laughed Lansdale.
"Miss Van Vetter hasn't made a confidant of me,
but I'll tell you a lot of encouraging little fibs, if
that will help you."</p>

<p>Bartrow fanned an opening in the tobacco-nimbus.
"What do you think about it?"</p>

<p>"I think I should find out for myself, if I were
you," said Lansdale, with becoming gravity.</p>

<p>"I don't believe you would."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Miss Van Vetter is rich."</p>

<p>"And Mr. Richard Bartrow is only potentially
so. That is a most excellent reason, but I shouldn't
let it overweigh common sense. From what Miss
Elliott has said I infer that her cousin's fortune is
not large enough to overawe the owner of a promising
mine."</p>

<p>Bartrow's chair righted itself with a crash.</p>

<p>"That's the devil of it, Lansdale; that's just
what scares me out. I've been pecking away in the
Myriad for a year and a half now, and we're in
something over four hundred feet&mdash;in rock, not
ore. If we don't strike pay in the immediate hence
I'm a ruined community. I've borrowed right and
left, and piled up debt enough to keep me in a cold
sweat for the next ten years. That's the chilly
fact, and I leave it to you if I hadn't better take
the night train and skip out for Topeka Mountain
without going near Steve Elliott's."</p>

<p>The red-badges were passing again, and Lansdale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
took time to consider it. The appeal threw a new
side-light on the character of the young miner, and
Lansdale made mental apologies for having misjudged
him. When he replied it was out of the
heart of sincerity.</p>

<p>"It's a hard thing to say, but if you have stated
the case impartially, I don't know but you would
better do just that, Dick. From what I have seen
of Miss Van Vetter, I should hazard a guess that
the success or failure of the Little Myriad wouldn't
move her a hair's-breadth, but that isn't what you
have to consider."</p>

<p>"No." Bartrow said it from the teeth outward,
looking at his watch. "It's tough, but I guess
you're right. I can just about make it if I get a
quick move. Will you go down to the train with
me?"</p>

<p>Lansdale assented, and they walked the few
squares to the Union Depot in silence. The narrow-gauge
train was coupled and ready to leave, and
Bartrow tossed his handbag to the porter of the
sleeping-car.</p>

<p>"You're a cold-blooded beggar, do you know
it?" he said, turning upon Lansdale with as near
an approach to petulance as his invincible good-nature
would sanction. "Here I've lost a whole
day and ridden a hundred and fifty miles just to get
a sight of her, and now you won't let me have it."</p>

<p>Lansdale laughed and promptly evaded the responsibility.
"Don't lay it on my shoulders; I
have sins enough of my own to answer for. It's a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
little hard, as you say, but it is your own suggestion."</p>

<p>"Is it? I don't know about that. It has been
with me for a good while, but it never knocked me
quite out until I began to wonder what you'd do in
my place. That settled it. And you're not out of
it by a large majority. What are you going to tell
them up at Elliott's?&mdash;about me, I mean."</p>

<p>"Why should I tell them anything?"</p>

<p>"Because you can't help yourself. Elliott knows
I'm in town,&mdash;knows we were going to eat together.
I met him on the way up to dinner."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll tell them anything you say."</p>

<p>"Thanks. Fix it up to suit yourself,&mdash;wired to
come back on first train, or something of that sort.
Anything'll do; anything but the truth."</p>

<p>Lansdale's smile was inscrutable. He was thinking
how impossible it would be for the most accomplished
dissembler to tell aught but the truth with
Constance Elliott's calm gray eyes upon him.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I shall make a mess of it."</p>

<p>"If you do, I'll come back and murder you. It's
bad enough as it is. I've got a few days to go on,
and I don't want them to know that the jig is
definitely up until it can't be helped."</p>

<p>"Then you'd better write a note and do your
own lying," said Lansdale. "I can spin fetching
little fictions on paper and sign my name to them,
but I'm no good at the other kind."</p>

<p>The engine-bell clanged, putting the alternative
out of the question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>"That lets me out," Bartrow said. "You go
up there and square it right for me; savez? And
say, Lansdale, old man; don't work yourself too
hard. In spite of the lamb-ranch, you look thinner
than usual, and that's needless. Good-by."</p>

<p>Bartrow wrung his friend's hand from the steps
of the Pullman, and Lansdale laughed quite cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Don't you waste any sympathy on me," he said.
"I'm going to disappoint you all and get well.
Good-night; and success to the Little Myriad."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Lansdale</span> stood watching the two red eyes on
the rear platform of the sleeping-car until the curve
on the farther side of the viaduct blotted them out;
after which he fell in with the tide of humanity
ebbing cityward through the great arch of the station,
and set out to do Bartrow's errand at the
house in Colfax Avenue.</p>

<p>On the way he found time to admire Bartrow's
manliness. The little deed of self-effacement promised
a much keener sense of the eternal fitness of
things than he had expected to come upon, in the
young miner, or in any son of the untempered wilderness.
Not that the wilderness was more mercenary
than the less strenuous world of an older
civilization&mdash;rather the contrary; but if it gave
generously it was also prone to take freely. Lansdale
wrought out the antithesis as a small concession
to his own point of view, and was glad to set Bartrow's
self-abnegation over against it. Assuredly
he would do what a friendly man might toward
making good the excuses of the magnanimous one.</p>

<p>It was Miss Van Vetter who met him at the door,
and he thought he surprised a shadow of disappointment
in her eyes when she welcomed him. But it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
was Constance who said, "Come in, Mr. Lansdale.
Where is Dick?"</p>

<p>She was holding the portière aside for him, and
he made sure of his ingress before replying. Being
of two minds whether to deny all previous knowledge
of such a person as Richard Bartrow, or to commit
himself recklessly to the hazards of equivocal explanations,
he steered a middle course.</p>

<p>"Am I my brother's keeper?" he demanded,
dropping into the easy-chair which had come to be
called his by right of frequent occupancy.</p>

<p>"Oh, I hope you haven't murdered him!" said
Connie, with a show of trepidation. "That's a
terribly suggestive quotation."</p>

<p>"So it is. But are not my hands clean?" He
held them up for inspection. "How are you both
this evening?"</p>

<p>Connie's eyes danced. "Mr. Lansdale, do you
happen to know anything about the habits of the
ostrich?"</p>

<p>Lansdale acknowledged defeat, extending his
hands in mock desperation. "Put the thumbikins
on if you must," he said, "but don't screw them
down too hard. I couldn't tell anything but the
truth if I should try."</p>

<p>"What have you done with Dick?"</p>

<p>"I have murdered him, as you suggested, and put
his remains in a trunk and shipped them East."</p>

<p>Miss Van Vetter looked horrified, but whether at
his flippancy or at the hideous possibility, Lansdale
could not determine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>"But, really," Connie persisted, with a look in
her eyes which would have exorcised any demon of
brazenness; "you dined with him, you know."</p>

<p>"So I did; but he had to go back to his mine on
the night train. I saw him off, and he made me
promise to come here and&mdash;and"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Square it?" Connie suggested.</p>

<p>"That is precisely the word,&mdash;his word. And
you will both bear me witness that I have done it,
won't you?"</p>

<p>Miss Van Vetter was cutting the leaves of a
magazine, and she looked up to say: "That is one
of the explanations which doesn't explain, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Lansdale collapsed in the depths of the chair.
"'I'm a poor unfort'net as don't know nothink,'"
he quoted. "Tell me what you'd like to have me
say and I'll say it."</p>

<p>"Why did Mr. Bartrow have to go back so unexpectedly?"
asked Myra. "He told Uncle Stephen
he would be in Denver two or three days."</p>

<p>Lansdale was not under bonds to keep the truthful
peace at the behest of any eyes save those of
Constance Elliott; wherefore he drew upon his
imagination promptly, and, as it chanced, rather unfortunately.</p>

<p>"He had a telegram from his foreman about a&mdash;a
strike, I think he called it."</p>

<p>"A strike in the Little Myriad!" This from
both of the young women in chorus. Then Connie
thankfully: "Oh, I'm so glad!" and Myra vindictively:
"I hope he'll never give in to them!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>Lansdale collapsed again. "What have I done!"
he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Constance set her cousin right, or tried to.</p>

<p>"It isn't a strike of the men; it's pay-ore&mdash;isn't
it, Mr. Lansdale?"</p>

<p>"Now how should I know?" protested the amateur
apologist. "A strike is a strike, isn't it? But
I don't believe it was the good kind. He wasn't at
all enthusiastic about it."</p>

<p>"That will do," said Connie. "Poor Dick!"
And Miss Van Vetter, who was not of the stony-hearted,
rose and went to the piano that she might
not advertise her emotion.</p>

<p>Lansdale picked himself up out of the ruins of his
attempt to do Bartrow a good turn, and hoped the
worst was over. It was for the time; but later in
the evening, when Myra had gone to the library for
a book they had been talking about, Connie returned
to the unfinished inquisition.</p>

<p>"You know more than you have told us about
Dick's trouble," she said gravely. "Is it very
serious?"</p>

<p>"Yes, rather." Lansdale made a sudden resolve
to cleave to the facts in the case, telling as few of
them as he might.</p>

<p>"It wasn't a strike at all, was it?"</p>

<p>"No; that was a little figure of speech. It is
rather the lack of a strike&mdash;of the kind you meant."</p>

<p>"Poor boy! I don't wonder that it made him
want to run away. He has worked so hard and so
long, and his faith in the Little Myriad has been
unbounded. What will he do?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know that. In fact, I think he is not
quite at the brink of things yet. But he is afraid
it is coming to that."</p>

<p>"How did he talk? Is he very much discouraged?
But of course he isn't; nothing discourages
him."</p>

<p>Lansdale was looking into the compelling eyes
and he forgot his rôle,&mdash;forgot that he had been
giving Constance to understand that the prospective
failure of the mine was the only cloud in Bartrow's
sky.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I can't confirm that." He spoke
hurriedly, hearing the rustle of Miss Van Vetter's
skirts in the hall. "He decided rather suddenly,&mdash;to
go back, you know. He intended coming here
with me this evening. I don't think he had ever
considered all the possibilities and consequences;
and we were talking it over. Then he decided not
to come. He is the soul of honor."</p>

<p>Constance nodded intelligence, and made the
proper diversion when her cousin came in with
the book. But Miss Van Vetter had overheard the
final sentence, and she put it away for future reference.</p>

<p>Lansdale said good-night a little later, and they
both went to the door with him. When he was
gone Myra drew Connie into the library and made
her sit down where the light from the shaded chandelier
fell full upon her.</p>

<p>"Connie, dear," she began, fixing her cousin with
an inquisitorial eye, "who is 'the soul of honor'?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>"It isn't nice to overhear things," said Connie
pertly.</p>

<p>"I might retort that it isn't nice to have confidences
with a gentleman the moment your cousin's
back is turned, but I sha'n't. Will you tell me
what I want to know?"</p>

<p>"We were talking about Dick."</p>

<p>Myra's hands were clasped over her knee, and
one daintily shod foot was tapping a tattoo on the
rug. "Was it anything that I ought not to know?"</p>

<p>Connie's pertness vanished, and the steadfast gray
eyes brightened with quick upwellings of sympathy.
"No, dear; it will doubtless be in everybody's
mouth before many days. You remember what I
told you once about Dick's prospects?&mdash;that day
we were on top of El Reposo?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, I think the Little Myriad isn't going to
keep its promise; Dick thinks so."</p>

<p>Myra sat quietly under it for a little while, and
then got up to go to the window. When she spoke
she did not turn her head.</p>

<p>"He will be ruined, you said. What will you
do, Connie?"</p>

<p>"I? What can I do? Poppa would lend him
more money, but he wouldn't take it,&mdash;not from
us."</p>

<p>Silence while the bronze-figured clock on the mantel
measured a full minute. Then:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There is one way you can make him take it."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>Myra gave a quick glance over her shoulder, as if
to make sure that her cousin was still sitting under
the chandelier.</p>

<p>"He believes&mdash;and so does your father&mdash;that
it is only a question of time and more money. He
couldn't refuse to take his wife's money."</p>

<p>Miss Van Vetter heard a little gasp, which, to
her strained sense, seemed to be more than half a
sob, and the arc-light swinging from its wire across
the avenue was blurred for her. Then Connie's
voice, soft and low-pitched in the silence of the book-lined
room, came to her as from a great distance.</p>

<p>"You are quite mistaken, Myra, dear; mistaken
and&mdash;and very blind. Dick is my good brother,&mdash;the
only one I ever had; not my father's son, but
yet my brother. There has been no thought of
anything else between us. Besides"&mdash;</p>

<p>Myra heard light footfalls and the rustle of
drapery, and stole another quick glance over her
shoulder. The big pivot-chair under the chandelier
was empty. The door into the hall was ajar, and
Connie's face, piquant with suppressed rapture, was
framed in the aperture.</p>

<p>"Besides, you good, dense, impracticable cuzzy,
dear,&mdash;are you listening?&mdash;Dick is head over ears
in love with&mdash;you."</p>

<p>The door slammed softly on the final word, and
there was a quick patter of flying feet on the stairs.
Myra kept her place at the window; but when the
arc-light had parted with its blurring aureole she
drew the big pivot-chair to the desk and sat down to
write.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>What she had in mind seemed not to say itself
readily, and there was quite a pyramid of waste
paper in the basket before she had finished her two
letters. She left them on the hall table when she
went up to her room, and Connie found them in the
morning on her way to the breakfast-room to pour
her father's coffee.</p>

<p>"I wish I might read them," she said, with the
mischievous light dancing in her eyes. "It's deliciously
suspicious; a letter to Dick, and one to her
man of business, all in a breath, and right on the
heels of my little bomb-shell. If she ever tries to
discipline me again,&mdash;well, she'd better not, that's
all."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Two</span> days after his return to the mine on Topeka
Mountain, Bartrow received a letter. It came up
from Alta Vista by the hands of one of the workmen
who had been down to the camp blacksmith
shop with the day's gathering of dulled tools, and
was considerably the worse for handling when it
reached its destination. Connie's monogram was on
the flap of the envelope, but the address was not in
Connie's handwriting. So much Bartrow remarked
while he was questioning the tool-carrier.</p>

<p>"Took you a good while, didn't it? Was Pat
sober to-day?"</p>

<p>"Naw; swimmin' full, same as usual."</p>

<p>"Spoil anything?"</p>

<p>"Burnt up a drill 'r two, spite of all I could do.
Laid off to lick me when he got through, but I lit
out 'fore he got round to it."</p>

<p>"Did, eh? It's a pity; he's a good blacksmith
if he'd only let whiskey alone. Try him in the
morning next time, and maybe you'll catch him
sober."</p>

<p>"Don't make any dif'rence 'bout the time o' day
with him. He's full all the time, he is."</p>

<p>Bartrow's curiosity was beginning to bestir itself,
but he put it under foot till he had climbed to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
three-roomed cabin on the bench above the tunnel-opening.
Wun Ling was laying the table for supper,
and the master of the mine sat down on the
porch to read his letter. It was from Miss Van
Vetter; and the glow on Bartrow's sunburned face
as he read it was not altogether the ruddy reflection
from the piled-up masses of sunset crimson in the
western sky.</p>

<p>"Dear Mr. Bartrow," she wrote: "Mr. Lansdale
has just been here, and we made him tell us
about your trouble, though he tried very hard not
to. From which we infer that you didn't want us
to know,&mdash;and that was wrong. If one cannot go
to one's friends at such times, it is surely a very
thankless world.</p>

<p>"Constance told me some time ago that you
might not be able to go on with the Little Myriad
without the investment of more capital, and I have
written about it to a friend of mine in the East
who has money to invest. You may call it a most
unwarrantable impertinence if you please, but I'm
not going to apologize for it,&mdash;not here. If you
would really like to humble me, I'll give you plenary
indulgence when you come to see us.</p>

<p>"I inclose my friend's Philadelphia address, and
I may say with confidence that I am quite sure he
will help you if you will write him.</p>

<p>"We have abundant faith in you and in the
Little Myriad. Don't think of giving up, and please
don't evade us when you are next in Denver."</p>

<p>Bartrow absorbed it by littles, and sat fingering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
the slip of paper with the Philadelphia address on
it, quite unheedful of Wun Ling's thrice-repeated
announcement that supper was ready. It was his
first letter from her, and the fact was easily subversive
of presence of mind. Not until the lilt of it
had a little outworn itself could he bring himself
down to any fair-minded consideration of the offer
of help. But when it finally came to that, he put
the letter in his pocket and went in to supper,
smiling ineffably and shaking his head as one who
has set his face flintwise against temptation.</p>

<p>An hour later, however, when he was smoking
his pipe on the porch step, the temptation beset him
afresh. His faith in the ultimate success of the
mine had never wavered. It was unshaken even
now, when he was at the end of his resources, and
a thing had happened which threatened to demand a
costly change in the method of exploiting the lode.
But to be confident for himself and for those who,
knowing the hazard, had helped him hitherto, was
one thing; and to take a stranger's money was quite
another. And when the stranger chanced to be the
friend of the woman he loved, a person who would
invest in the Little Myriad solely on the ground
of Miss Van Vetter's recommendation, the difference
magnified itself until it took the shape of a prohibition.</p>

<p>The light had faded out of the western sky, and
the peaks of the main range stood out in shadowy
relief against the star-dusted background. The
homely noises in Wun Ling's sanctum had ceased,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
and silence begirt the great mountain. Bartrow
tossed the extinct pipe through an open window, and
began to pace the length of the slab-floored porch.
It was not in him to give up without another
struggle; a final struggle, he called it, though none
knew better that there is no final struggle for a
strong man save that which crowns perseverance
with the chaplet of fruition. The temptation to
grasp the hand held out to him was very subtle. If
Miss Van Vetter could have been eliminated&mdash;if
only the proposal had come direct from the Philadelphia
capitalist, instead of through her.</p>

<p>The sound of footsteps on the gravel at the tunnel's
mouth broke into his reverie, and the figure of
a man loomed dimly in the darkness at the foot of
the path leading up to the cabin. It was McMurtrie,
the mining engineer in charge of the Big
Bonanza at Alta Vista. Bartrow called down to
him.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Mac? Don't come up; I'll be
with you in a second."</p>

<p>The engineer sat down on a tool-box and waited.</p>

<p>"I'm a little late," he said, when Bartrow came
down the path. "It's pay-day at the Bonanza.
Get a lamp and let's go in and have a look at your
new grief."</p>

<p>"You didn't need to tramp up here in the dark,"
Bartrow rejoined, feeling in a niche in the timbering
for a miner's lamp. "I'd given you up for to-night."</p>

<p>"Oh, I said I'd come, and I'm here. I know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
how it feels to be on the ragged edge,&mdash;been there
myself. Is that the best lamp you could find? It
isn't much better than a white bean. Pick it up a
little higher so I can see the wet spots. It's too
chilly to go in swimming to-night."</p>

<p>They were picking their way through the damp
tunnel, Bartrow ahead with the lamp held high.
The "new grief" was an apparent change in the
direction of the ore-bearing crevice from its slight
inclination upward to a sharp pitch downward; and
Bartrow had asked McMurtrie to come up and look
at it.</p>

<p>In the heading the engineer took the lamp and
made a careful examination of the rock face of the
cutting, tracing the outline of the vein with the
flame of the lamp, and picking off bits of the shattered
rock to determine the lines of cleavage. Bartrow
stood aside and waited for the verdict; waited
with a tense thrill of nervousness which was quite
new to him; and the monotonous drip-drip of the
water percolating through the tunnel roof magnified
itself into a din like the ringing of hammers upon
an anvil.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you say?" he queried, when the
engineer made an end and began to fill his pipe.</p>

<p>"You're in for it, Dick,&mdash;here, hold this lamp a
minute, will you? It's a pretty well-defined dip in
the formation, and I'm afraid it has come to stay.
That means an incline."</p>

<p>The echo took up Bartrow's ironical laugh and
gave it back in mocking reiteration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; an incline at the end of a four-hundred-and-forty-foot
tunnel, and a steam hoist, and a
pumping outfit, and a few other little knickknacks.
Say a couple of thousand dollars or so before I can
turn a wheel."</p>

<p>McMurtrie bent to light his pipe at the flame of
the lamp. "That's about the size of it. Hold that
lamp still, can't you?"</p>

<p>"Hold it yourself," retorted Bartrow; and he
took a turn in the darkness to steady his nerves.
When he stumbled back into the dim nimbus of
lamplight he had fought and won his small battle.</p>

<p>"Don't lay it up against me, Mac," he said, in
blunt contrition. "It knocked me out for a minute.
You know I've been backing my luck here for all
I'm worth."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know that. What will you do now?"</p>

<p>"Quit; come off the perch; shut up shop and
pull down the blinds. It's all there is to do."</p>

<p>"And give it up?"</p>

<p>"And give it up. Bank's broke; or at least it
will be when I've paid the men another time or
two."</p>

<p>McMurtrie had Scotch blood in his veins, and
was cannily chary of offering unasked advice.
None the less, he did it.</p>

<p>"I'd borrow a little more nerve and go on, if it
were mine."</p>

<p>"So would I if I could."</p>

<p>"Can't you?"</p>

<p>Bartrow said "no," changed it to "yes," and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
then qualified the assent until it, too, became a negation.</p>

<p>"It's a pity," was the engineer's comment. "I
believe another hundred feet would let you in for a
decently good thing."</p>

<p>"So do I. But it might as well be a thousand.
I know when I'm downed."</p>

<p>McMurtrie scoffed openly at that, taking his pipe
from his mouth to say: "That's the one thing you
don't know. You'll chew on it a while and go to
Denver; and in a day or so your men will get orders
to go on. I've seen you downed before. Why
don't you go back East and marry a rich girl?
That's the way to develop a mine."</p>

<p>It was a random shot, but it went so near the
mark that Bartrow winced, and was thankful that
the flaring miner's lamp was not an arc-light. And
his rejoinder ignored the matrimonial suggestion.</p>

<p>"You're off wrong this time, Mac. I wish you
didn't have to be. But it's no use. I'm in debt
till I can't see out over the top of it, and I couldn't
raise another thousand on the Myriad if I should
try,&mdash;that is, not in Colorado. If I go to Denver
it'll be to turn over my collateral and let everybody
down as easy as I can."</p>

<p>"Then don't go yet a while."</p>

<p>Bartrow took the lamp and led the way out of
the tunnel.</p>

<p>"I did mean to stand it off to the last minute,"
he said, when they were once more under the stars,
"but I don't know as it's worth while now. Will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
you come up to the shack and smoke a few lines?
No? Then wait till I get my coat and I'll walk
down to camp with you. I want to do a little wiring
before I turn in."</p>

<p>They parted at the railway station above the
camp at the foot of Bonanza Mountain, and Bartrow
went in to send his message. In the hour of
defeat he yearned, manlike, for sympathy; and it
was to Connie that his cry went out. Notwithstanding
the earnestness of it, the appeal was consistently
characteristic in its wording.</p>

<p>"I'm hunting sympathy. Can you give me a
lonesome hour or two if I come down? Answer
while I wait."</p>

<p>He asked the night operator to rush it, and sat
down with his feet on the window-sill to smoke out
the interval. A half-hour later, when the operator
was jogging Denver for a reply to his "rush," the
din of an affray floated up to the open window from
the camp in the gulch. The operator came to the
window and looked down upon the twinkling lights
of the town.</p>

<p>"That's the blacksmith again," he said. "He's
been on a steady bat for two weeks, and the camp
isn't big enough to hold him."</p>

<p>"He'll kill himself, if he don't mind," Bartrow
prophesied. "He's raw yet, and hasn't found out
that a man can't stand the drink up here that he
could in the valley."</p>

<p>"No. Doc said he had a touch of the jimmies last
night. He yelled for his daughter till they heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
him up at the shaft-house of the Bonanza. McMurtrie
said"&mdash;But what the engineer's commentary
had been was lost to Bartrow, since the
clicking sounder was snipping out the reply to the
"rush" message.</p>

<p>The operator wrote it out and handed it to Bartrow.
The answer was as characteristic as the appeal.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Two of the three of us go to Boulder to-morrow
to return by the late train. The other one is most
sympathetic. Come.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the long day-ride from Alta Vista to Denver,
Bartrow dwelt upon Myra's letter until the hopefulness
of it took possession of him, urging him to reconsider
his determination to give up the fight on
the Little Myriad. That which seems to have fortified
itself beyond peradventure of doubt in the night
season is prone to open the door to dubiety in the
morning; and the hope which McMurtrie's verdict
had quenched came to life again, setting the mill of
retrieval agrind, though, apart from the suggestion
in Myra's letter, there was little enough for grist.</p>

<p>From admitting the hope to considering ways and
means was but a step in the march of returning
confidence; and, setting aside Myra's proposal as
an alternative which would bring victory at the expense
of the cause in which the battle was fought,
he was moved to break his promise to himself and
to ask help of Stephen Elliott. This decision was
not reached without a day-long struggle, in which
pride and generosity fought shoulder to shoulder
against the apparent necessity. The pioneer had
more than once offered to back the promise of the
Little Myriad; but Bartrow, knowing Elliott's
weakness in the matter of money keeping, had
steadily refused to open another door of risk to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
old man who had fathered him from boyhood, and
whose major infirmity was an open-handed willingness
to lend to any borrower.</p>

<p>But the necessity was most urgent. Bartrow rehearsed
the condoning facts and set them over
against his promise to himself. If he should give
up the fight the Little Myriad would be lost, he
would be left hopelessly in debt, and the beatific
vision, with Miss Van Vetter for its central figure,
vanished at once into the limbo of things unrealizable.
Moreover, the investment would be less
hazardous for the pioneer than at any previous time
in the history of the mine. Notwithstanding the
discouragements, it was a heartening fact that the
ore-bearing vein was steadily widening; and the last
mill-run assay, made a week before, had shown a
cheering increase in value.</p>

<p>Bartrow weighed the pros and cons for the twentieth
time while the train was speeding over the
ultimate mile of the long run, and finally yielded to
the importunate urgings of the necessity. The first
step was to take Connie into his confidence; and
when the train reached Denver he hurried to the
hotel, full of the new hope and eager to begin the
campaign of retrieval. While he was inscribing his
name in the register the clerk asked a question.</p>

<p>"Just come down from the range, Mr. Bartrow?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Can you give me my old room?"</p>

<p>"Certainly." The clerk wrote the number opposite
the name. "What do they say up in the
carbonate camp about the Lodestar business?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Lodestar? I don't know. I haven't been
in Leadville. I came down from the Bonanza district
on the other line. Anything broke loose?"</p>

<p>"Haven't you heard? The big producer is
played out."</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"Fact; struck a 'lime horse' two weeks ago, and
they've been keeping it dark and unloading the
stock right and left. You are not in it, I hope?"</p>

<p>Bartrow was not, but he knew that Elliott was;
knew, too, that in any unloading <i>sauve qui peut</i> the
old pioneer would most likely be one of those found
dead in the deserted trenches. Wherefore he slurred
his supper and hastened out to the house in Colfax
Avenue, not to ask help, as he had prefigured, but
to ascertain if there were not some way in which a
broken man might tender it.</p>

<p>There was a light in the library and none in the
parlor; and Bartrow, being rather more a brevet
member of Stephen Elliott's family than a visitor,
nodded to the servant who admitted him, hung up
his coat and hat, and walked unannounced into the
lighted room. When he discovered that the library
held but one occupant, that the shapely head bending
over a book in the cone of light beneath the
reading-lamp was not Connie's, he realized the magnitude
of Connie's duplicity, and equanimity forsook
him.</p>

<p>Miss Van Vetter shut her finger in her book and
smiled as if his sudden appearance were quite a
matter of course.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hoped you would come," she said. "Have
you been to dinner?"</p>

<p>The prosaic question might have enabled a less
ingenuous man to cover his discomposure with some
poor verbal mantle of commonplace or what not;
but Bartrow could only murmur "Good Lord!"
sinking therewith into the hollow of the nearest
chair because his emotion was too great to be borne
standing.</p>

<p>Since she was not a party to Connie's small plot,
Myra was left to infer that her visitor was ill, and
she rose in sympathetic concern.</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Bartrow! is anything the matter?
Shall I get you something? a glass of wine, or"&mdash;</p>

<p>Bartrow shook his head and besought her with
both hands to sit down again. "No, nothing,
thank you; it's miles past that sort of mending.
Do you&mdash;do you happen to know where your
cousin is?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes; she has gone to Boulder with Uncle
Stephen."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I thought you were going," Bartrow stammered.</p>

<p>It did not occur to Miss Van Vetter to wonder
why he should have thought anything about it.</p>

<p>"I thought so myself, up to the last moment,"
she rejoined.</p>

<p>Bartrow leaned forward with his hands on his
knees.</p>

<p>"Miss Myra, would you&mdash;do you mind telling
me why you didn't go?" He said it with reproachful
gravity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Van Vetter's poise was an inheritance which
had lost nothing in transmission, but the unconscious
reproach in his appeal overset it. Under less trying
conditions her laugh would have emancipated
him; but being still in the bonds of unreadiness, he
could only glower at her in a way which lacked
nothing of hostility save intention, and say, "I
should think you might tell me what you're laughing
at!"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing&mdash;nothing at all. Only one would
think you were sorry I didn't go. Are you?"</p>

<p>"You know well enough I'm not." This time
the reproach was not unconscious. "But you haven't
answered my question. I have a horrible suspicion,
and I want to know."</p>

<p>"It was Connie's mistake. I was to meet them
at the station at half past four&mdash;I am sure she said
half past four&mdash;and when I went down I found the
train had been gone an hour. Did you ever hear
of such a thing?"</p>

<p>Miss Van Vetter did not know that the small
arch-plotter had exhausted her ingenuity trying to
devise some less primitive means of accomplishing
her purpose; but Bartrow gave Connie full credit
for act and intention.</p>

<p>"She'd do worse things than that; she wouldn't
stick at anything to carry her point," he said
unguardedly.</p>

<p>Myra laughed again. "I hope you don't ask
me to believe that she did it purposely," she said.</p>

<p>"Oh, no; of course not. I don't ask you to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
believe anything&mdash;except that I'm foolishly glad
you missed the train," rejoined the downright one,
beginning to find himself.</p>

<p>"Are you, really? I was almost ready to doubt
it."</p>

<p>Bartrow was not yet fit to measure swords of
repartee with any one, least of all with Miss Van
Vetter, and the quicksand of speechlessness engulfed
him. His helplessness was so palpable that it presently
became infectious, and Myra was dismayed to
find herself growing sympathetically self-conscious.
Her letter lay between their last meeting and this,
and she began to wonder if that were the barrier.
When the silence became portentous, Bartrow gathered
himself for another dash toward enlargement.
It was that or asphyxia. The very air of the room
was heavy with the narcosis of embarrassment.</p>

<p>"Your letter came yesterday," he began abruptly.</p>

<p>"Did it? And you have come to tell me to&mdash;to
tell me to mind my own business? as I said you
might?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed, I haven't. But I can't do it, all
the same&mdash;drag your friend in on the Myriad."</p>

<p>"Was Mr. Lansdale mistaken? Don't you need
more capital to go on with?"</p>

<p>"Need it?&mdash;well, yes; rather. But I can't take
your Mr. Grimsby's money."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because"&mdash;the low-pitched hollow of the big
lounging-chair seemed to put him at a disadvantage,
and he struggled up out of it to tramp back and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
forth before her&mdash;"well, in the first place, because
he <i>is</i> your friend; and if he wasn't, I have no
security to offer him&mdash;collateral, I suppose he'd
call it."</p>

<p>"He is not exactly my friend, within your meaning
of the word; and he will not ask you to secure
him."</p>

<p>He stopped and looked down upon her. She was
shading her eyes from the sheen of the reading-lamp
and turning the leaves of the book.</p>

<p>"What does he know about the Little Myriad?
anything more than you have told him?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"And yet you say he is willing to put up money
on it?"</p>

<p>"He is ready to help you&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>Bartrow's brows went together in a frown of perplexity.
"As long as I'm not going to let him, I
suppose I haven't any right to ask questions, but"&mdash;</p>

<p>She put the book on the table and looked up at
him with something of Connie's steadfastness in her
eyes.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I was foolish to try to make even such
a small mystery of it; but I thought&mdash;I was so
anxious to&mdash;to put it in such a way as to"&mdash;</p>

<p>The words would not discover themselves; and
Bartrow, to whom the mystery was now no mystery,
helped her over the obstruction.</p>

<p>"As to make it easy for me. I think I catch on,
after so long a time. Mr. Grimsby is your business
manager, isn't he?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>"My solicitor; yes."</p>

<p>"That's what I meant. And it was going to be
your own money?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>He met her gaze with a smile of mingled triumph
and admiration.</p>

<p>"It was a close call, and you'll never know how
near I came to falling down," he said. "It was a
fearful temptation."</p>

<p>The pencilled brows went up with a little arch of
interrogation between them.</p>

<p>"A temptation? Why do you call it that?"</p>

<p>Bartrow was slowly coming to his own in the
matter of unconstraint. "If you had ever dabbled
in mineral, you'd know. When a fellow gets in
about so deep, he'd foreclose the mortgage on his
grandfather's farm to get money to go on with. I
didn't read between the lines in your letter. I thought
the Philadelphia man was some friend of yours who
was interested in a general way, and the temptation
to fall on his neck and weep was almost too much
for me."</p>

<p>"You still call it a temptation."</p>

<p>"It was just that, and nothing less. I had the
toughest kind of a fight with myself before I could
say no, and mean it."</p>

<p>"But why should you say no? You believe in the
Little Myriad, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Sure. But that's for myself&mdash;and for a few
people who knew the size of the risk when they
staked me. So far as I've gone with it, it's only a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
big game of chance; and I wouldn't let you put
your money into it unless I knew it was the surest
kind of a sure thing."</p>

<p>"Not if I believe in it, too? Not if I am willing
to take the chances that you and the others have
taken?" Myra conceived that her mistake lay in
putting it upon the ground of a purely business
transaction, and changed front with truly feminine
adroitness. "Won't you let me have just a tiny
share of it? Enough so that when I go back to
Philadelphia I can say that I am interested in a
mine? I should think you might. I'll promise to
be the most tractable and obedient stockholder you
have."</p>

<p>She made the plea like a spoiled child begging for
a toy, but there was no mistaking the earnestness
of it. Bartrow felt his fine determination oozing,
and was moved to tramp again, making a circuit
of the entire room this time, and saying to himself
with many emphatic repetitions that it could not be
possible,&mdash;that her motive was only charitable,&mdash;that
he was nothing more to her than Connie's
friend. When he spoke again his circlings had
brought him to the back of her chair.</p>

<p>"You're making it fearfully hard for me, and
the worst of it is that you don't seem to know it.
You think I am a mining crank, like all the rest of
them, and so I am; but there was method in my
madness. I never cared overmuch for money until
I came to know what it is to love a woman who has
too much of it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>There was manifestly no reply to be made to such
a pointless speech as this, and when he resumed his
circumambulatory march she began to turn the
leaves of the book again. When it became evident
that he was not going to elucidate, she said, "Meaning
Connie?"</p>

<p>"No, not meaning Connie." He had drifted
around to the back of her chair again. "I wish
you'd put that book away for a few minutes. It
owls me."</p>

<p>"I will, if you will stop circling about and talking
down on me from the ceiling. It's dreadfully
distressing."</p>

<p>He laughed and drew up a chair facing her; drew
it up until the arm of it touched hers.</p>

<p>"It's a stand-off," he said, with cheerful effrontery;
"only I didn't mean my part of it. Let's see,
where were we? You said, 'Meaning Connie,' and
I said, 'No, not meaning Connie.' I meant some
one else. Until I met her, the Little Myriad was
merely a hole in the ground, not so very different
from other holes in the ground except that it was
mine&mdash;and it wasn't the Little Myriad then, either.
After that, it got its name changed, and its mission,
too. From that day its business was to make it
possible for me to go to her and say, 'I love you;
you, yourself, and not your money. I've money
enough of my own.'"</p>

<p>She heard him through with the face of a graven
image. "And now?"</p>

<p>"And now I can't do it; I can never do it, I'm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
afraid. The Little Myriad has gone back on me,
and I'm nearer flat broke to-day than I've ever
been."</p>

<p>"But this unfortunate young person who has too
much money&mdash;she is young, isn't she?&mdash;has she
nothing to say about it?"</p>

<p>Bartrow answered his own thought rather than
her question. "She couldn't be happy with everybody
saying she'd staked her husband."</p>

<p>"Has she told you that?"</p>

<p>"No; but it's so,&mdash;you know it's so."</p>

<p>Bartrow was no juggler in figures of speech, and
his fictitious third person threatened to become unmanageable.</p>

<p>Her smile was good to look upon. "I don't
know anything of the kind. I think she would be
very foolish to let such an absurd thing make her
unhappy&mdash;supposing any one should be unkind
enough to say it."</p>

<p>"They would say it, and I'd hear of it; and
then there'd be trouble."</p>

<p>"But you say you love her; isn't your love
strong enough to rise above such things? You think
the sacrifice would be hers, but it wouldn't; it
would be yours."</p>

<p>"I don't see how you make that out."</p>

<p>Myra's heart sank within her. It hurt her immeasurably
to be driven to plead her own cause, but
the money-fact was inexorable; and the look in
Bartrow's eyes was her warrant when she dared to
read it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, can't you see?" The words wrought themselves
into a plea, though she strove to say them dispassionately.
"If it touch your self-respect ever so
little, the sacrifice is all yours."</p>

<p>That point of view was quite new to Bartrow. He
took time to think it out, but when the truth
clinched itself he went straight to the mark.</p>

<p>"I never saw that side of it before&mdash;don't quite
see it now. But if you do, that's different. It's
you, little woman; and I do love you&mdash;you, yourself,
and not your money. I wish I could go on and
say the rest of it, but I can't. Will you take me
for better or for worse&mdash;with an even chance that
it's going to be all worse and no better?"</p>

<p>Her eyes filled with quick tears, and her voice was
tremulous. "It would serve you right if I should
say no; you've fairly made me beg you to ask me!"</p>

<p>Her hand was on the arm of the chair, and he
possessed himself of it and raised it to his lips with
gentle reverence.</p>

<p>"You'll have to begin making allowances for me
right at the start," he said humbly. "When I make
any bad breaks you must remember it's because
I don't know any better, and that away down deep
under it all I love you well enough to&mdash;to go to
jail for you. Will you wait for me while I skirmish
around and try to get on my feet again?"</p>

<p>"No"&mdash;with sweet petulance.</p>

<p>"There it is, you see; another bad break right
on top of the first. Suppose you talk a while and
let me listen. I'm good at listening."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll wait, if you want me to,&mdash;and if you will
let me help you to go on with the Little Myriad."</p>

<p>Bartrow's laugh had a ring of boyish joy in it.</p>

<p>"Back to the old cross-roads, aren't we? I'll
let you in on it now; but if you take the mine you'll
have to take the man along with the other incumbrances,&mdash;simultaneously,
so to speak."</p>

<p>"I thought you were anxious to wait."</p>

<p>"If you were as poor as I am, I'd ask you to
make it high noon to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Oh! the money again. Can't we put it aside,
once for all? There isn't so much of it as you may
imagine."</p>

<p>Bartrow overleaped the barrier at a bound.</p>

<p>"Then let's make it noon to-morrow. If we are
going to push the Myriad I ought to go back to-morrow
night."</p>

<p>She tried to scoff at him, but there was love in
her eyes.</p>

<p>"Connie said once that you were Young-man-afraid-of-his-horses,
but she doesn't know you. I
believe you more than half mean it."</p>

<p>"I do mean it. If I sit here and look at you
much longer I shall be begging you to make it nine
o'clock instead of twelve. Don't ask me to wait
very long. It'll be hard enough to go off and leave
you afterward. It's a good bit more than a hundred
miles in a straight line from Denver to Topeka
Mountain."</p>

<p>"I'm going with you," she said calmly.</p>

<p>"You?&mdash;to live in a wicky-up on the side of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
bald mountain? But you know what it is; you've
been there. You'd die of the blues in a week."</p>

<p>"Would I?" She rose and stood beside his
chair. "You don't know much about me, yet, do
you? If the 'wicky-up' is good enough for you, it
is good enough for me. I am going with you, and
I'm going to make that dear little log cabin a place
that you will always be glad to remember,&mdash;if I
can."</p>

<p>He drew her down on the arm of the chair.</p>

<p>"Don't talk to me that way, Myra,&mdash;you mustn't,
you know. I'm not used to it, and it breaks me all
up. If you say another word I shall want to make
it seven o'clock in the morning instead of nine."</p>

<p>"Can you wait a month?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Three weeks?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>She gave up in despair. "You are dreadfully
unreasonable."</p>

<p>"I know it; I was born that way and I can't
help it. I sha'n't insist on to-morrow, because I'm
not sure that Wun Ling has anything for us to eat;
but one week from to-morrow, when I've had time
to stock up and straighten up a bit, is going to be
the limit. Can you make it?"</p>

<p>"What if I say no?"</p>

<p>"I shall come anyway."</p>

<p>She bent over until her lips touched his forehead.</p>

<p>"That is your answer, only you don't deserve it.
And now will you answer my question? I asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
you when you came in if you had been to dinner,
and you said 'Good Lord!'"</p>

<p>"Did I? I think I must have been a bit rattled.
You see, I'd just heard some bad news, and I was
expecting to find Connie, and wasn't expecting to
find you."</p>

<p>"Did Connie write you she would meet you?"</p>

<p>He had one hand free to fish out the day-old telegram
and give it to her. She read it with a swift
blush crimsoning cheek and neck.</p>

<p>"The unscrupulous little tyke!" she said; and
then, with self-defensive tact: "But you said you
had bad news."</p>

<p>"Yes. A mine that our good old Uncle Steve is
pretty deeply into has gone dry."</p>

<p>"Failed, you mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's it. I wish you'd teach me how to
talk English,&mdash;good clean English, like yours.
Connie has tried it, but pshaw! she's worse than I
am. But about the Lodestar: I don't know how
deep the old man is in; he's such an innocent old
infant about putting up money that I'm awfully
afraid they have salted him. You must pump Connie
and find out. I'll be in Leadville to-morrow
night, and if there is anything to be done on the
ground I'll do it. The old man has been a second
father to me."</p>

<p>Myra promised, and went back once more to the
unanswered dinner query.</p>

<p>"Now you remind me of it, I believe I haven't
been to dinner," he admitted. "But that's nothing;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
a meal or two more or less isn't to be mentioned at
such a time as this."</p>

<p>"I am going to get you something."</p>

<p>"No, don't; I'm too happy to eat."</p>

<p>But she insisted, and when she came back with a
dainty luncheon on a tea-tray he did ample justice
to it, if for no better reason than that she sat on
the other side of the small reading-table and made
tea for him.</p>

<p>Afterward, when the time drew near for the
Elliotts' return, he took his leave, though it was yet
early.</p>

<p>"They are the best friends I have on earth," he
said, when Myra went to the door with him, "but
somehow, I feel as if I didn't want to meet anybody
I know,&mdash;not to-night. I want to have it all to
myself for a few hours."</p>

<p>She laughed at that; a laugh with an upbubbling
of content and pure happiness in it; and sent him off
with his heart afire. When he was halfway down the
walk she recalled him. He came back obediently.</p>

<p>"It will cost you something every time you do
that," he protested, exacting the penalty. "Was
that what you wanted?"</p>

<p>"Of course not! I merely wanted to ask you
what it is to 'owl' a person. You said I 'owled'
you."</p>

<p>"Did I? Well, you don't; you never can. That
is the best definition I can think of: something you
can never do to me. May I say good-night again?
the way I did a minute ago?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>The glare of the arc-light swinging between its
poles across the avenue was quite ruthless, and there
were passers-by in straggling procession on the sidewalk.
But at the critical instant the kindly incandescence
burned blue, clicked, fizzed, and died down
to a red spot in the darkness. For which cause
Bartrow presently went his way, with the heart-fire
upblazing afresh; and when Myra won back to the
library and the cosy depths of the great chair, the
color scheme of fair neck and cheek and brow was
not altogether the reflection from the crimson shade
of the reading-lamp.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<p>CONSTANCE TO MYRA</p>


<p><span class="smcap">My dear Lady Bountiful</span>: Your letter&mdash;the
ridiculous one&mdash;came yesterday. The idea of
your proposing in the very morning of your honey-month
to take the Colfax Avenue house and turn it
into a home for indigent relatives! As Tommie
would put it, "Wot are you givin' us!"</p>

<p>But seriously, cuzzy dear, it's quite out of the
question. Papa wouldn't hear to it, and besides, we
are getting along very cosily now, re-learning a good
many lessons that prosperity makes one forget. One
of them is that gratitude isn't quite like the dodo,&mdash;gone
into fossilistic extinction, you know.</p>

<p>Margaret Gannon is one of the instances. She
has taken a room in our block, and there is no limit
to her great Irish tender-heartedness. If I'd let
her, she would make me sit down and hold my
hands while she does the housework of our three
rooms. In spite of all I can say or do, she does do a
great deal of it; and I can hear her sewing-machine
buzzing deep into the night to pay for it.</p>

<p>Tommie is another. The day we moved down
here from the old home in Colfax Avenue that "irreclaimable
little savage," as you once called him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
brought me his surplus of a dollar and something
and asked me to "blow it in" for him. Think of
it and weep, you luxury-spoiled darling! I could
have hugged him, dirt and all. And since that day
he has been my Ariel, in more ways than you would
think possible. He is so sharp and keen-witted;
and his philanthropy has developed into a passion.</p>

<p>Mr. Lansdale has been most kind. That is the
proper phrase, I believe, but now that I have written
it down it seems trite and meaningless. If I say
that he has fairly earned the right to sign himself
"Robert Lansdale, Gentleman," you will understand.
The change in our circumstances has been a
test that he alone of all our friends has been able to
endure unmoved. I don't say that others are not
kind and sympathetic, but they are&mdash;well, they
are different. Now that I can say it without hurting
you, I'll admit that I've always had a good bit
of contempt for culture of the imported variety (I
think I have been spelling it "culchah"), but Mr.
Lansdale has converted me. It is worth something
to be able to rise superior to circumstances,&mdash;the
circumstances of others, I mean,&mdash;and, between us
two, it's a virtue to which we new people haven't
quite attained.</p>

<p>I presume you read the Denver papers, and if
you do you know all I could tell you about the person
whom you once said was better worth saving
than other people. Mr. Lansdale, who was one of
the original trio, you remember, talks very sparingly
of Mr. Jeffard; from which I infer that there isn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
much to be said,&mdash;in mixed company. The newly
arrived one lives in an apartment building, and
papa says they are beginning to call him a miser
on the street. They'd say that of any capitalist
who wouldn't invest in at least one "ground-floor"
a day; but I think you will agree with me that they
can't say anything worse than the truth about him.
I haven't had the ill-chance to meet him yet (I hope
I'll be spared that), but I am afraid Tommie has
been spying upon him,&mdash;for reasons of his own
which he won't explain. I happened to overhear
the final volley of a small battle royal between my
Ariel and Margaret the other day, which had in it
a hint of an unnamable thing,&mdash;a thing which involves
Margaret and the unworthy one. You may
remember that he once posed as her <i>deus ex machina</i>.
And she has grown dangerously beautiful in her
year of uprightness.</p>

<p>When you write, tell me all about your plans for
the summer; and believe me always</p>

<div class='poem'>
Your cousin-content,<br />

<div class='center'><br />MYRA TO CONSTANCE</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Connie</span>: Really, the S. P. C. C. ought
to take you in hand! To think of the cold-blooded
way in which you hoodwinked us up to the very last
moment, making us believe that the Lodestar involvement
was next to nothing, and keeping the home
intact solely for the purpose of providing a proper
stage-setting for the final act of our little comedy-drama!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
It's fairly heart-breaking; the more since
you won't let us share with you, as we'd be glad to.
Before you saw fit to confide in us, Dick had used
every argument short of a pick-handle to convince
me that I should presently go back to Denver and
creature comforts, leaving him here to go on delving
in the Myriad. I only laughed at him, but I'll recant
if you will listen to reason, and let me make a
home for you and Uncle Stephen. But as between
living a three-quarter widow in Denver on mere
visiting terms with you and your father, and hibernating
here with Dick, you may be sure I shall
choose the latter.</p>

<p>We are both as enthusiastic as can be over the
prospects of the mine. The new machinery is on
the way, and we are down twenty feet on the incline.
Another month will surely carry it into pay-rock.
(You see I am learning to talk "mineral-English"
with the best of them.) Under the circumstances,
I don't blame Dick for wanting to stay right here
every day; and it won't be so lonesome for me as
you may imagine. You see I have Dick, and he can
be a whole cityful upon occasion.</p>

<p>You wouldn't know "The Eyrie" (Dick says the
altitude is so great that we had to have a high-sounding
name) since we have begun to remodel it.
We are to have another room, a larger kitchen for
Wun Ling (oh, he is a celestial treasure!&mdash;quite
the archangel of the culinary host), a huge chimney,
with immense fireplaces, against a possible winter
here, and a wider porch,&mdash;board-floored, if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
please. And inside I have rugged and portièred,
and pictured and bric-a-bracked, until the pristine
barkiness of the place is all but effaced.</p>

<p>So far, with the exception of an occasional call
from Mr. McMurtrie, we have been "each other's
own best company;" but if I stay up all summer it
will be conditional upon your and Uncle Stephen's
spending at least a month with us when the hot
weather makes your block uncomfortable. Don't
say no beforehand, unless you want to make me
quite disgusted.</p>

<p>Mr. Lansdale is a lineal descendant in the direct
line of the Chevalier,&mdash;the <i>sans peur et sans reproche</i>
one; you know I've always said that of him.
It chokes me when I think of what is lying in wait
for him. Isn't there the least little glimmer of
hope? He looked so bright and eager on our wedding
day that I could almost make myself believe he
was going to get well. You must be very, very
careful, Connie dear; not to encourage him too
much, I mean; not unless you&mdash;but I sha'n't say
it without your warrant.</p>

<p>What you say about Margaret Gannon's Irish
true-heartedness reminds me of our own wild Irishman.
He is the mine blacksmith, a perfect Sheridan
for wit and repartee when he is sober, and a maniac
of maniacs when he is drunk,&mdash;which happens whenever
Dick relaxes his vigilance for a single hour.</p>

<p>The other day Pat (if he has any other name
I've never heard it) did a thing heroic. They are
using dynamite in the tunnel, and after the noon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
blasts one of the miners went in before the deadly
gas had been properly "ventilated" out. One of
the others saw him stumble and go headlong down
the incline, and the cry went back to the entrance.
Pat heard it (he was sober that day), flung his tools
to the four winds, dashed into the pit of death, and
came out black in the face, but with the man on his
shoulder, just as Dick got down to the entrance.
Wasn't that fine?</p>

<p>As you surmise, we have read all that the newspapers
are saying about Mr. Jeffard. Isn't it queer
that he should develop into a millionaire miser!
Dick has told me a great deal about him,&mdash;at
least about the Mr. Jeffard he used to know,&mdash;and
whatever sins he may have had to answer for in
those days, avarice was not one of them. I suppose
it is another case of money-spoiling, but I can't help
wanting to doubt your latest suspicion of him. I
read your letter to Dick, and he shook his head when
I came to that part; said he couldn't believe it,
even on your testimony,&mdash;that the man might be
capable of all sorts of villainy, but not that. So I
am going over to Dick's point of view far enough to
ask you not to be too hard upon the "unworthy
one" just because he is no longer one of your poverty-stricken
sinners,&mdash;he <i>was</i> that once, wasn't
he? The rich sinners need charity quite as really
as the poor; of a different kind, to be sure, and not
always as easy to exercise as the other, but none the
less necessary.</p>

<p>This is all you are going to get to-night. Dick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
has just come up from the mine, and he says I
sha'n't write any more whatever.</p>

<div class='poem'>
Your loving cousin,<br />
<span class="smcap">Myra</span>.<br />
</div>


<div class='center'><br />
LANSDALE TO BARTROW<br />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Richard</span>:&mdash;What with a mine for
a taskmaster and a wife for your leisure I can fancy
you tossing this letter aside unopened. But the
promise which you exacted is herein kept, and it
must plead my excuse for breaking into your honeymoon
with a few pages of barren gossip.</p>

<p>First, as to Miss Elliott and her good father.
Your foreboding went nearer the mark than the
ostensible fact. They were merely postponing the
evil day until after your wedding, and when the
crash came it turned out to be no less than a catastrophe.
Stephen Elliott met it like a man, giving
up everything to his creditors, and coming down to
a life of the barest necessities with the serenity of a
philosopher, happy, apparently, that the well of assets
was deep enough to brim the tank of liability, though
at the expense of the final drop.</p>

<p>I am told that he was left quite without resources
other than a small sum of money which one of the
creditors absolutely refused to accept; and he assures
me that he will once more shoulder pick and shovel
and go afield again as soon as the season is a little
farther advanced. I confess frankly that the heroism
of it bedazes me. If there be any finer example of
dauntlessness in the heart of man, the novellers have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
not yet portrayed it for us. He was sixty-three last
January, and he promises to begin the search for another
competence with all the enthusiasm and ardor
of youth!</p>

<p>Constance you know, and I need not assure you
that the sudden down-dropping touches her not at
all; or if at all, only on the side of her beneficences
to others. So far as one may perceive, the change
for her is only of encompassments. She is as
much above it as she was superior to the cheapening
effect of an elastic bank account. To me she seems
the sweeter for the chastening, though really, I presume,
she is neither better nor worse for it,&mdash;nor
any different. You may be sure that my first call
upon them after the submergence was made with a
heartful of sympathy,&mdash;which I took away with me,
and with it a lesson in sincerity and simple-heartedness
rare enough in my experience. There is gentle
blood and enviable in these two. My pen is too
clumsy to ink in the details of this picture for you.</p>

<p>As to Jeffard: When he made his appearance
I struck hands with your point of view sufficiently
to meet him as if nothing save good fortune had
overtaken him,&mdash;an attitude which it is sometimes
as difficult for me to maintain as it appears altogether
impossible for some others who used to know
him. By which you will understand that he is
ostracized in a way, or would be in any casting of
the potsherd votes by the unthinking majority.</p>

<p>I am bound to say, however, that the whiplash of
public opinion does not seem to be quite long enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
to reach him. A fortnight ago, for reasons charitable
or experimental, as you please, I got him a
bidding to one of Mrs. Calmaine's "ridottos." You
know Mrs. Calmaine and her tolerance, and you will
appreciate the situation when I tell you that I had
to man&oelig;uvre a bit for the formal invitation, though
Jeffard used to be in her good book. Jeffard accepted,
and I went with him to see what would
befall. There were a good many there who had
known the prehistoric Jeffard, and while they did
not pointedly ignore him, they seemed to be divided
between a desire to cold-shoulder the man and to
conciliate the prospective millionaire;&mdash;wherefore
they compromised by giving him what you would
call "the high hand-shake."</p>

<p>Whatever may have been my motive in dragging
him into it, Jeffard's own reasons for going were
confessedly experimental. So much he confided to
me on our early retreat from the house of mirth.
"I wanted to find out where I stand," he said, "and
these good people have been quite explicit. Don't
get me any more invitations." And after a time
he added, "I can buy them when I want them."
From which you will infer that he will henceforth
sit in the seat of the scornful, and this, I fear, is the
lamentable fact.</p>

<p>Touching his present mode of life, it borders on
the puzzling. With a bank deposit which is currently
reported to reach seven figures, and which is
doubtless well up in the sixes, he lives in two rooms
in a block, and takes his meals at the club. A very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
rich spendthrift might do this, you will say, saving
at the spigot and wasting at the bung; but so far as
my observation goes, Jeffard seems not to know that
his barrel has a bung. And if any of the staves
have started on the side of dissipation, the leak is
not yet apparent to me. The other evening, when I
let drive a little arrow pointed with a gibe at his
penuriousness, he laughed and reminded me of something
he had said one night in the famine time
when we were dining by the help of a small windfall
of mine. "I told you I should be a miser if the
tide ever turned," said he, "and you scoffed at me.
I assure you I can account for every dollar I have
spent since the Midas began to pour them in."</p>

<p>This is his attitude as he defines it, but I can
qualify the accusation a little on the friendly side.
I should rather say that he had set his mark at
thrifty frugality. He is not niggardly; in benevolences
which may be paid for in the coin of effort
he is still generous; and if he were living on a
clerk's income people would commend him.</p>

<p>But I fancy I hear you cry "Enough!" and this
ends with the heartiest good wishes for you both.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Lansdale</span> had defined himself as a reporter on the
"Coloradoan," but in reality he was rather more,&mdash;or
less,&mdash;being that anomalous member of a newspaper
staff known as the literary editor. Kershaw
had taken him in doubtfully, and had afterward
wondered why a man with such an evident gift for
journalistic work should prefer to spend his days
and nights writing stories which no one would buy.
For, contrary to all precedent, when he could sink
his literary ambitions the fictionist proved to be a
general utility journalist of no uncertain ability,
running the office gamut from proof-reading in an
emergency to filling the editorial columns on the rare
occasions when Kershaw was absent.</p>

<p>It was during one of the Kershawan absences that
the letter to Bartrow was written; and the hands of
the paper-weight clock on the desk were pointing to
the supper hour when Lansdale dropped the pen
and drew down the desk-curtain. Unlike his chief,
he rarely ignored the supper recess, though a walk
in the open air often took the place of the meal; and
having his night's work well in hand, he let himself
into the corridor, said "Down!" and was presently
set afoot at the street level.</p>

<p>As usual, the swift rush down the elevator-shaft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
dizzied him, and he had to steady himself before he
could go on. When he allowed himself to think
about it he realized that these dizzyings were growing
commoner, and were set awhirl by slighter
exciting causes. Another man, or a man with
another ailment, might have given the unnerving
weakness its true name and place and succumbed to
it; but Lansdale's <i>métier</i> had been love-transformed
into unflinching hopefulness, and the trivialities of
the daily walk had come to be so many blind and
desperate sorties against the indrawing lines of the
relentless besieger. For of the two lions standing
in the way to the House Beautiful that named
Inequality had been slain by the collapse of the
Lodestar; wherefore this other of Ill-health must
either slay or be slain, since love would not be
denied.</p>

<p>This was what was in his resolute step when he
went forth into the night; into the whirl of life
on the peopled streets and sidewalks. Some vague
supper promptings were present, but a stronger impulse
sent him riverward, away from the thickly
peopled walks and down into the wholesale district
toward a shabby apartment building which had been
left stranded on the bar of traffic when the uptown
tide had set in.</p>

<p>The little excursion was purposeless, as had been
many another in the same direction; but when he
found himself opposite the stairway of the shabby
building he wondered if he might not go up and ask
Constance for a cup of tea. He was wise in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
generation, and he had long since discovered that
the way to Constance Elliott's heart lay through
helpings accepted. With love abounding for any
human soul at need, there were precious reserves of
tenderness for those to whom she might minister.</p>

<p>Lansdale glanced up at the two lighted windows
on the third floor and crossed the street. In the
stair archway, which was dimly lighted by a single
inefficient gas-jet, he stumbled upon a bit of by-play,
in which the actors were a man and a woman leaning
together across the stair-rail, and a barelegged
boy spying upon the twain from the dimnesses beyond.
The little tableau fell apart at the sound of
the intruder's footsteps. The boy vanished mysteriously,
the woman ran upstairs, and the man turned
half angrily, as one faulted. It was Jeffard; and
when he recognized Lansdale he spoke quickly, as if
to forestall possible comment.</p>

<p>"Hello!&mdash;think of the devil and you'll hear the
clatter of his hoofs. I was just about to go up to
the print-shop to see if I could find you. Been to
supper?"</p>

<p>"No; I was"&mdash;</p>

<p>Jeffard cut in again swiftly, with edgings streetward.
"That's lucky; neither have I. Let's go
up to the club."</p>

<p>Lansdale acceded rather reluctantly, since a cup
of tea with Constance easily outweighed the grill-room
prospect.</p>

<p>"I'll go with you, though I can't promise to play
much of a knife and fork," he said. "I was just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
going up to ask Miss Elliott to give me a cup of
tea."</p>

<p>They were turning the corner above the stranded
apartment house before Jeffard returned the shuttle
of speech.</p>

<p>"So the Elliotts live down there now, do they?"</p>

<p>Lansdale said "Yes," and began to rummage in
recollection. Had Jeffard been on Constance Elliott's
visiting list in the prehistoric time? It was
probable that he had been,&mdash;with Dick Bartrow
for his sponsor. But at this point recollection turned
up the mental notes of a certain talk with Bartrow,
in which the downright one had confessed his sins of
omission Jeffardward. So Lansdale added a query
to the affirmative.</p>

<p>"Yes; they live in the Thorson Block. Do you
know them?"</p>

<p>Jeffard's reply was no reply. "I'll have to take
time to think about it," he said; and they had
traversed the necessary streets and found a table <i>à
deux</i> in the grill-room at the club before he pieced
out the unfinished rejoinder.</p>

<p>"You asked me if I knew the Elliotts. I did
know Miss Elliott,&mdash;as I knew some of those people
at Mrs. Calmaine's the other evening. It's
quite likely she does not remember me."</p>

<p>Lansdale's brain went apart again, and the reflective
half of it continued the rummaging. On
the two or three occasions when he had mentioned
the newest star in the bonanzine firmament Constance
had been visibly disturbed. The nature of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
her resentment had not been quite obvious, but Jeffard's
tardy rejoinder made it clear. She had known
Jeffard and was sorry to be reminded of him.</p>

<p>Lansdale had not done full justice to himself in
slurring his own point of view in the letter to Bartrow.
So far as he had analyzed it he had been
content to call it negative, but it was not quite that.
On the contrary, it was complaisant, concerning
itself chiefly with the things of past sight, and not
unduly with those of present rumor. Jeffard might
be an indubitable scoundrel in his later reincarnation,
as certain of the mining-camp newspapers had
intimated in their accounts of the fight for possession;
but in the older time he had been a good
fellow and a generous friend at a pinch. Lansdale
remembered some of the generosities, and his heart
went soft at the recollection of them. Kershaw had
kept the secret of the prearranged purchase of certain
unusable manuscripts, but the pigeon-holes of a
newspaper office are open archives, and one day
Lansdale had found a clue which he had followed
out to his comforting; a string of hitherto unexplainable
incidents, with two stanch friends at the
end of it.</p>

<p>One of these loyal friends was the man at whom
public opinion was now pointing a dubious finger;
and while Lansdale was munching his toast and
drinking his cup of weak tea in troubled silence, it
began to be discomfortingly evident that he must
presently take sides for or against the man whose
hospitality he was at that moment sharing. Left to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
itself, the insularity in him would have evaded the
issue. Loyalty of the crucible-test degree of fineness&mdash;the
loyalty of the single eye&mdash;must needs
sit below the salt at the table of any analyst of his
kind; and Lansdale was a student first and a partisan
only when benefits unforgot constrained him.
Moreover, frankness in the last resort is rarely at
its best in any vivisector of his fellow-men, and it
was with no little difficulty that Lansdale made shift
to overleap the barrier of reserve.</p>

<p>"Jeffard," he began, when the weak tea was low
in the cup, "we used to be pretty near to each other
in a time that I like to remember; will you bear
with me if I say what is in my mind?"</p>

<p>"Surely," said Jeffard; but the tone was not of
assurance.</p>

<p>"You know what the newspapers intimated last
fall, and what people are saying of you now?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And that your silence makes it rather hard for
your friends?"</p>

<p>"I have no friends, Lansdale."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you have; or you would have if you
would take the trouble to set yourself aright."</p>

<p>"What if I cannot set myself aright?"</p>

<p>"I should be sorry to believe that,&mdash;more than
sorry to be driven to admit the alternative."</p>

<p>"What is the alternative?"</p>

<p>Lansdale hesitated, as one who has his point at
his adversary's breast and is loath to drive it in. "I
don't quite like to put it in words, Jeffard; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
English is a bit harsh. But you will understand
that it is the smiting of a friend. So long as you
refuse to say you didn't, the supposition is that you
have robbed a man to whom you were under rather
heavy obligations."</p>

<p>"Is that Bartrow's supposition?"</p>

<p>"He says it isn't, but I'm afraid the wish is the
father to the thought: in his case as in&mdash;as in that
of others." Lansdale added the inclusive in the hope
that the wound would be the better for probing.</p>

<p>Jeffard's laugh was altogether bitter. "'Give a
dog a bad name,'" he quoted. "Do you know, I
fancied Dick would be obstinate enough to stand out
against the apparent fact?"</p>

<p>"That is precisely what he has done, and with
less reason than the most devoted partisan might
demand. You know you told him that the claim
was Garvin's. He wouldn't believe the newspaper
story; he insisted that you would be able to 'square'
yourself, as he phrased it, when you came out."</p>

<p>Jeffard was looking past his interlocutor, out and
beyond to where the farther tables were emptying
themselves of the late diners.</p>

<p>"Yet it is his supposition; and your own, you
were going to say. Is it Miss Elliott's also?"</p>

<p>Lansdale resisted the impulse to rummage again,
and said: "I don't know that&mdash;how should I
know? But rumor has made the charge, and you
have not denied it."</p>

<p>"I don't mean to deny it&mdash;not even to her.
But neither have I admitted it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>"My dear Jeffard! aren't the facts an admission?&mdash;at
least, so long as they stand uncontradicted."</p>

<p>"Everybody seems to think so,&mdash;and I can afford
to be indifferent."</p>

<p>"Having the money, you mean?&mdash;possibly. Am
I to take that as an admission of the facts?"</p>

<p>"Facts are fixtures, aren't they? things not to
be set up or set aside by admissions or denials. But
you may take it as you please."</p>

<p>Lansdale shook his head as one whose deprecation
is too large for speech. "I can't begin to understand
it, Jeffard,&mdash;the motive which could impel
a man of your convictions, I mean."</p>

<p>Jeffard broke forth in revilings. "What do you
know about my convictions? What do you know
about anything in the heart of man? You have a
set of formulas which you call types, and into which
you try to fit all human beings arbitrarily, each
after his kind. It's the merest child's-play; a fallacy
based on an assumption. No two men can be
squared by the same rule; no two will do the same
things under exactly similar conditions. Character-study
is your specialty, I believe; but you have yet
to learn that the human atom is an irresponsible
individuality."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I haven't; I grant you that. But
logically"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Logic has nothing whatever to do with it. It's
ego, pure and unstrained, in most of us; a sluggish
river of self, with a quicksand of evil for its bottom."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>Lansdale borrowed a gun of his antagonist, and
sighted it accurately.</p>

<p>"What do you know about humanity as a whole?
What do you know about any part of it save your
own infinitesimal fraction?&mdash;which seems to be a
rather unfair sample."</p>

<p>Jeffard confessed judgment and paid the costs.
"I don't know very much about the sample, Lansdale.
One time&mdash;it was in the sophomore year, I
believe&mdash;I thought I knew my own potentialities.
But I didn't. If any one had prophesied then that
I had it in me to do what I have done, I should
have demanded a miracle to confirm it."</p>

<p>"But you must justify yourself to yourself,"
Lansdale persisted.</p>

<p>"Why must I? That is another of your cut-and-dried
formulas. So far from recognizing any such
obligation, I may say that I gave up trying to account
for myself a long time ago. And if I have found it
impossible, it isn't worth while for you to
try."</p>

<p>Lansdale was not the man to bruise his hands
with much beating upon the barred doors of any
one's confidence. So he said, "I'm done. It's
between you and your conscience,&mdash;if you haven't
eliminated that with the other things. But I had
hoped you'd see fit to defend yourself. The eternal
query is sharp enough without the pointing of particular
instances."</p>

<p>Jeffard squared himself, with his elbows on the
table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you want an hypothesis, too?&mdash;as another
man did? Take this, and make the most of it.
You knew me and my lacks and havings. You
knew that I had reached a point at which I would
have pawned my soul for the wherewithal to purchase
a short hour or two of forgetfulness. Hold that picture
in your mind, and conceive that a summer of
unsuccessful prospecting had not changed
me for better or worse. Is the point of view unobstructed?"</p>

<p>"The point of view is your own, not mine," Lansdale
objected. "And, moreover, the summer did
change you, because advancement in some direction
is an irrefrangible law. But go on."</p>

<p>"I will. This man whom you have in mind was
suddenly brought face to face with a great temptation,&mdash;great
and subtle. Garvin drove the tunnel
on the Midas three years ago and abandoned it as
worthless. It was my curiosity which led to the
discovery of the gold. It was I who took the sample
to the assayer and carried the news of the bonanza
to Garvin. I might have kept the knowledge to
myself, but I didn't. Why? do you ask? I don't
know&mdash;perhaps because it didn't occur to me.
What followed Bartrow has told you, but not all.
Let us assume that the race to Aspen was made in
good faith; that this man who had put honor and
good report behind him really meant to stand between
a drunken fool and the fate he was rushing
upon. Can you go so far with me?"</p>

<p>Lansdale nodded. He was spellbound, but it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
the artist in him and not the man who hung breathless
upon the edge of expectancy.</p>

<p>"Very well; now for the crux. This man knelt
behind a locked door and heard himself execrated
by the man he was trying to save; heard the first
kindly impulse he had yielded to in months distorted
into a desperate plan to rob the cursing maniac. Is
it past belief that he crept away from the locked
door and sat down to ask himself in hot resentment
why he should go on? Is it not conceivable that he
should have begun to give ear to the plea of self-preservation?&mdash;to
say to himself that if the maniac
were no better than a lost man it was no reason that
the treasure should be lost also?"</p>

<p>It was altogether conceivable, and Lansdale nodded
again. Jeffard found a cigar and went on while he
was clipping the end of it.</p>

<p>"But that was not all. Picture this man at the
crumbling point of resolution tiptoeing to the door
to listen again. He has heard enough to convince
him that the miracle of fortune will be worse than
wasted upon the drunken witling. Now he is to
hear that the besotted fool has already transferred
whatever right he had in the Midas to the two despoilers;
signed a quitclaim, sold his miracle for a
drink or two of whiskey, more or less. Are you
listening?"</p>

<p>Lansdale moistened his lips with the lees of the
tea in the empty cup, and said, "Yes; go on."</p>

<p>Jeffard sat back and lighted the cigar. "That's
all," he said curtly. "It's enough, isn't it? You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
knew the man a year ago; you think you know him
now. What would he do?"</p>

<p>If the hypothesis were intended to be a test of
blind loyalty it missed the mark by just so much as
the student of his kind must hold himself aloof from
sympathetic entanglements. Lansdale weighed the
evidence, not as a partisan, but rather as an onlooker
whose point of view was wholly extrinsic.</p>

<p>"I understand," said he; "the man would do as
you have done. It's your own affair. As I said a
few minutes ago, it is between you and your private
conscience. And I dare say if the facts were known
the public conscience wouldn't condemn you. Don't
you want to use the columns of the 'Coloradoan'?"</p>

<p>Jeffard's negative was explosive. "Do you write
me down a fool as well as a knave? Damn the
public conscience!"</p>

<p>"Don't swear; I was only offering to turn the
stone for you if you've anything to grind."</p>

<p>"I haven't. If I wanted the consent of the
majority I could buy it,&mdash;buy it if I had shot the
maniac instead of letting him shoot me."</p>

<p>"Possibly; and yet you couldn't buy any fraction
of it that is worth having," Lansdale asserted, with
conviction. "There are a few people left who have
not bowed the head in the house of Rimmon."</p>

<p>The cynical hardness went out of Jeffard's eye
and lip, and for the first time since the proletary's
reincarnation, Lansdale fancied he got a brief glimpse
of the man he had known in the day of sincerity.</p>

<p>"A few, yes; the Elliotts, father and daughter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
for two, you would say. I wonder if you could help
me there."</p>

<p>"To their good opinion?&mdash;my dear Jeffard, I'm
no professional conscience-keeper!"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't mean that. What I had in mind
is a much simpler thing. A year ago Miss Elliott
gave me of her abundance. She meant it as a gift,
though I made it a loan and repaid the principal&mdash;when
I was able to. But I am still in her debt.
Measured by consequences, which are the only true
interest-table, the earnings of her small investment
are hardly to be computed in dollars and cents.
Naturally, she won't take that view of it, but that
does not cancel my obligation. Will you help me
to discharge it? They need money."</p>

<p>Lansdale let the appeal simmer in the pot of reflection.
His inclination was to refuse to be drawn
into any such entanglement; but the opportunity to
lessen by ever so little the burdens of the woman he
loved was not to be lightly set aside. None the
less, the thing seemed impossible.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it's too big for me, Jeffard; I
shouldn't know how to go about it. Don't misunderstand
me. I shouldn't stick at the necessary
equivocations; but if you know Miss Elliott you
must know that Machiavelli himself couldn't be
insincere with her. She would have to be told the truth,
and"&mdash;</p>

<p>He left the sentence incomplete, and Jeffard took
it up at the break.</p>

<p>"And if she should acknowledge my obligation&mdash;which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
she would not&mdash;she would refuse to be reimbursed
out of Garvin's money. That is why I
haven't sent her a note with a check in it.  Will
you have another cup of tea?"</p>

<p>Lansdale took the query as a dismissal of the
subject and pushed back his chair. On the way out
they passed a late incomer; a florid man, with a
nervous step and the eye of preoccupation. He
nodded to Lansdale in passing, and Jeffard said,
"Do you know him?"</p>

<p>"Yes; it's Finchly,&mdash;John Murray's man of
business."</p>

<p>Jeffard had apparently relapsed into the deeper
depths of cynicism again.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. That's the charitable euphemism.
Murray is a day laborer, transmogrified by a lucky
strike into a millionaire. He doesn't know enough
to write his own name, much less how to keep a
great fortune from dissolving, so he hires a manager.
It was a happy thought. What does Finchly get?"</p>

<p>Lansdale laughed. "A good living, doubtless."</p>

<p>"Of course; and much more, with the pickings.
But there is a salary which is supposed to be the
consideration, isn't there?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; and the figure of it varies with the
imagination of the gossips from ten to fifty thousand
a year."</p>

<p>Jeffard stopped to relight his cigar, and Lansdale
fancied that the Finchly query went out with the
spent match. But Jeffard revived it a square farther
on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>"Suppose we assume, for the sake of argument,
that the man has a conscience. How much could he
justly take for the service rendered?"</p>

<p>They were at the entrance of the "Coloradoan"
building, and Lansdale took out his notebook and
made a memorandum.</p>

<p>"That is good for a column," he said; "'The
Moral Responsibility of Millionaire-Managers.' I'll
answer your question later, when I've had time to
think it over."</p>

<p>"But, seriously," Jeffard insisted. "Is it worth
ten thousand a year?&mdash;or the half of it? The
man is only a cashier,&mdash;a high-class accountant at
best."</p>

<p>"Finchly is much more than that; he is Murray's
brain as well as his pen-hand. But if he were only
a money-counter, a money-counter's salary would be
enough; say two or three thousand a year, to be
liberal."</p>

<p>Jeffard nodded and was turning away; had in
fact taken three steps streetward, when he came
back to return to the subject dropped at the supper
table as though there had been no hiatus.</p>

<p>"You were going to say she would refuse to take
Garvin's money, and I said it for you. Would it
make it any easier if I can assure you that the
money I shall put in your hands is honestly mine?&mdash;that
James Garvin has no claim, ethical or otherwise,
upon it? Take time to consider it,&mdash;with an eye
to Miss Elliott's present needs rather than to my
havings or wishes in the matter."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>Lansdale was off his guard, and the human side
of him came uppermost in the swift rejoinder,&mdash;"Then
you didn't tell me the whole truth? The
Midas is honestly yours, after all?"</p>

<p>Jeffard turned away and snapped the ash from
his cigar. "Don't jump at conclusions," he said.
"It's always safer to go on voting with the majority.
What I said has nothing to do with the story of the
man and his temptation; but the meanest laborer is
worthy of his hire. I worked all winter with pick
and shovel in the Midas. Good-night."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was early in June when the pneumatic drill
in the Little Myriad was smashed by a premature
blast, and the master of the mine was constrained
to make a flying trip to Denver to replace it. As
a matter of course, if not, indeed, of necessity, Myra
went with him. They traveled by the night train,
breakfasted on canned viands out of the Pullman
buffet, and so took Constance by surprise.</p>

<p>Myra had projects in view, some Utopian and
others more Utopian, with her relatives for nuclei;
and when Richard the untactful had been sent
about his machinery business, she settled down for
a persuasive day with Constance. Now Constance
had been taken unawares, but she was of those who
fight best at a disadvantage, and the end of the day
found the Utopian projects still in air, being held
in suspension by an obstinate young person who
steadily refused to make of herself a vessel meet for
condolence and cousinly beneficence.</p>

<p>"It's no use, cuzzy dear; you shall have an option
on the help stock when there is any for sale,
but at present there are no quotations."</p>

<p>Thus Connie, at the very end of the persuasive
day. Upon which the young wife, with patience
outwearing or outworn, retorts smartly:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose you think it's heroic&mdash;your living like
this; but it isn't. It is just plain poverty pride,
which is all well enough to keep the crowd out, but
which is simply wicked when it makes you shut the
door in our faces. Think of it&mdash;you living here in
three rooms at the top of a block when the Myriad
has begun to pay dividends! I didn't mean to tell
you just yet, but Dick is going to buy back the
Colfax Avenue house, and it shall stand empty till
doomsday if you won't go and live in it."</p>

<p>In times not long past Connie would have returned
railing for railing&mdash;with interest added;
but the reproachful day had been no less trying
to her than to Myra, and the poverty fight&mdash;and
some others&mdash;were sore upon her. Hence her disclaimer
was of courageous meekness, with a smile
of loving appreciation to pave the way.</p>

<p>"I hope Dick will do no such preposterous thing&mdash;unless
you want it for yourselves. You know it
would be quite out of the question for us to take it.
Or to do anything but make the best of what has
happened," she added.</p>

<p>Myra was standing at a window, looking down
into the street where the early dusk was beginning
to prick out the point-like coruscations of the arc-lights.
There was that in Connie's eyes which beckoned
tears to eyes sympathetic; and she found it
easier to go on with her back turned upon the room
and its other occupant.</p>

<p>"To make the best of it, yes; but you are not
making the best of it. Or, if you are, the best is miserably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
bad. You are looking thin and wretched, as
if&mdash;as if you didn't get enough to eat."</p>

<p>There was a touch of the old-time resilience in
Connie's laugh. "How can you tell when you're
not looking at me? Indeed, it hasn't come to that
yet. We have enough, and a little to spare for
those who have less."</p>

<p>Myra had been searching earnestly all day for
some little rift into which the wedge of helpfulness
might be driven, and here was an opening&mdash;of
the vicarious sort.</p>

<p>"Won't you let me be your purseholder for
those who have less, Connie? That is the very
least you can do."</p>

<p>Constance willed it thankfully. After the trying
day of refusals it was grateful to find something
that could be conceded.</p>

<p>"I believe I told you once that I wouldn't be
your proxy in that way, didn't I? But I will, now.
You are so much better than your theories, Myra."</p>

<p>Myra left the window at that, wrote a generous
check before the concession should have time to
shrink in the cooling, and then went over to sit on
the denim-covered lounge with her arm around her
cousin's waist.</p>

<p>"Now that you have begun to be reasonable,
won't you go a step farther, Connie, dear? I know
there are troubles,&mdash;lots of them besides the pinching.
Can't you lean on me just a little bit? I do
so want to help you."</p>

<p>Connie did it literally, with her face on Myra's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
shoulder and a sob at the catching of her breath.
Myra let her take her own time, as a judicious comforter
will, and when the words came they wrought
themselves into a confession.</p>

<p>"Oh, Myra, I thought I was so strong, and I'm
not!" she wept. "The bullet in a gun hasn't less
to say about where it shall be sent. I said it wasn't
the pinch, but it is&mdash;or part of it is. Poppa has
set his heart upon trying the mountains again, old
as he is, and he can't go because&mdash;because there
isn't money enough to outfit him with what he
could carry on his back!"</p>

<p>"And you would have let me go without telling
me!" said Myra reproachfully. "He shall have a
whole pack train of 'grub stake,'&mdash;is that what I
should say?&mdash;and you shall come and stay with us
while he is away. Consider that a trouble past, and
tell me some more. You don't know how delicious
it is to be permitted to pose as a small god in a car."</p>

<p>"Yes, I do," Connie responded, out of a heartful
of similar ecstasies. "But it isn't a trouble past:
he won't let you do it. Everybody has been offering
to lend him money, and he won't take it."</p>

<p>"He will have to take it from me," said Myra,
with prompt decision. "I'll make him. And when
he goes, you will come to us, won't you?"</p>

<p>Constance looked up with a smile shining through
the tears. "You're good, Myra, just like Dick!
But I can't, you know. I must stay here."</p>

<p>"Why must you?" To the querist there seemed
to be sufficiently good reasons, from the point of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
view of the proprieties, for setting Connie's decision
aside mandatorily, but Myra had grown warier if not
wiser in her year of cousin-kenning.</p>

<p>"There are reasons,&mdash;duties which I must not
shirk."</p>

<p>"Are they namable?"</p>

<p>"Yes; Margaret is the name of one of them."</p>

<p>Myra's disapproval found vent in gentle
foot-tappings. To the moderately compassionate
on-looker it would seem that Constance had long since
filled that measure of responsibility,&mdash;filled and
heaped it to overflowing. But again the experienced
one was discreet.</p>

<p>"As Dick would put it, you have 'angeled' Margaret
for a year and more. Isn't she yet able to
stand alone?"</p>

<p>Connie's answer was prompt and decisive. "Quite
as well able as the best of us would be under similar
conditions."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't make it conditional; but we've
never been able to keep step in that journey. Why
is Margaret's case exceptional?"</p>

<p>"Did I say it was? It isn't. She is just one
of any number of poor girls who are trying to live
honestly, with the barriers of innocence all down
and an overwhelming temptation always beckoning."</p>

<p>Myra shook her head. "That is making temptation
a constraint, when it can never be more than a
lure. I must confess I can't get far enough away
from the conventional point of view to understand
how a young woman like Margaret, who has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
lifted and carried and set fairly upon her feet, could
be tempted to go back to the utter misery and
degradation of the other life."</p>

<p>Constance spoke first to the sophism, and then to
the particular instance.</p>

<p>"It is not true that temptation is always a lure.
It is oftener a constraint. And you say you can't
understand. It is terribly simple. They sin first
for a thing which they mistake for love; but after
that it is for bread and meat, and surcease from toil
which has become a mere frenzied struggle to keep
body and soul together. You don't know what it is
to be poor, Myra,&mdash;with the barriers down. Have
you any idea how much Margaret earned last week,
working steadily the six days and deep into the
nights?"</p>

<p>"Oh, not very much, I suppose. But her necessities
are not large."</p>

<p>"Are they not? They are as large as yours or
mine. She must eat and drink and have a bed to
sleep on and clothes to cover her. And to provide
these she was paid three dollars and eighty-five cents
for her week's work; and two dollars of that had to
go for rent. Is the temptation a lure or a constraint
in her case?"</p>

<p>Myra was silenced, if not convinced, and she went
back to the fact existent with sympathy no more
than seemingly aloof.</p>

<p>"You hinted at Margaret's peculiar besetment in
one of your letters. Is that what you have to stay
and fight?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>Constance nodded assent.</p>

<p>"I have been hoping you were mistaken. Dick
is still loyally incredulous. Isn't there a chance
that you or Tommie, or both of you, have taken too
much for granted?"</p>

<p>Connie's "No" was almost inaudible, and there
was chastened sorrow in her voice when she went on
to tell how Tommie had seen Jeffard and Margaret
together, not once, but many times; how the man
was always persuading, and the woman, reluctant at
first, was visibly yielding; how within a week Tommie
had seen Jeffard give her money.</p>

<p>"And she took it?" Myra queried.</p>

<p>"She didn't want to take it. Tommie says she
almost fought with him to make him take it back.
But he wouldn't."</p>

<p>Myra's sympathy circled down, but it alighted
upon Connie. "You poor dear! after all your
loving-kindnesses and helpings! It's miserable; but
you can't do anything if you stay."</p>

<p>"Yes, I can. I couldn't stay alone, of course,
and she will give up her room and come here to live
with me. That will give me a better hold on her
than I have now."</p>

<p>"But if you had a hundred eyes you couldn't
safeguard her against her will!"</p>

<p>"No; but it isn't her will,&mdash;it's his. And he
will not come here."</p>

<p>Myra's brows went together in a little frown of
righteous indignation. "I should hope not,&mdash;the
wretch! You were right, after all, Connie, and I'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
retract all the charitable things Dick wanted me to
say. He is too despicable"&mdash;</p>

<p>It was Connie's hand on the accusing lips that
cut short the indignant arraignment.</p>

<p>"Please don't!" she pleaded. "He is all that
you can say or think, but my ears are weary with
my own repetitions of it."</p>

<p>Myra took the hand from her lips and held it fast
while she tried to search her cousin's face. But the
gathering dusk had mounted from the level of
the street to that of the upper room, and it baffled
the eye-questioning.</p>

<p>"Connie Elliott! I more than half believe"&mdash;She
stopped abruptly, as if there had been some
dumb protest of the imprisoned hand, and then went
on with a swift change from accusation to gentle
reproach. "I believe you have only just begun to
tell me your troubles,&mdash;and I've been with you all
day! What are some more of them?"</p>

<p>"I have told you the worst of them,&mdash;or at least
that part of them which makes it impossible for me
to go away. But there is another reason why I
ought to stay."</p>

<p>"Is that one namable, too?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but perhaps you won't understand. And
you will be sure to tell me it isn't proper. I think
one of Mr. Lansdale's few pleasures is his coming
here."</p>

<p>"Few remaining pleasures, you would say, if you
were not too tender-hearted. Is it wise, Connie?"</p>

<p>"Why not?&mdash;if it is a comfort to him?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>Myra hesitated, not because she had nothing to
say, but because she knew not how to say the thing
demanded.</p>

<p>"You haven't given me leave to be quite frank
with you, Connie. But it seems to me that your
kindness in this case is&mdash;is mistaken kindness."</p>

<p>Constance's rejoinder was merely an underthought
slipping the leash. "It is not to be expected that
any one would understand," she said.</p>

<p>"But I do understand," Myra asserted, this time
with better confidence. "I'm not supposed to have
the slightest inkling of your feelings,&mdash;you've never
lisped a word to me,&mdash;but Mr. Lansdale's motives
are plain enough to be read in the dark. If he
were a well man he would have asked you to marry
him long ago."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" said Constance half absently.
"I'm not so sure about that. He is far away from
home and wretchedly ill; and he has many acquaintances
and few real friends."</p>

<p>"But he loves you," Myra persisted.</p>

<p>"He has never said anything like that to me."</p>

<p>"It is quite possible that he never will, in view
of the insurmountable obstacle."</p>

<p>"His ill-health, you mean? Myra, dear, you
surely know love better than that&mdash;now. Love is
the one thing which will both sow and reap even in
the day when the heavens are of brass and the earth
is a barren desert."</p>

<p>The under-roar of traffic in the street made the
silence in the upper room more effective by contrast;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
like the sense of isolation which is often sharpest
in a jostling throng. Myra rose and went to the
window again, coming back presently to stand over
Constance and say, "I suppose it is ordained that
you should be a martyr to somebody or something,
Connie, dear; and when the time comes I'm not
going to say you nay, because I think you will be
happier that way. If Mr. Lansdale should be
tempted to say that which I am sure he has determined
not to say, is your answer ready?"</p>

<p>Connie's hands were clasped over one knee, and
the poise was of introspective beatitude. But the
answer to Myra's query was not irrelevant.</p>

<p>"He is the truest of gentlemen; what would your
answer be, Myra?"</p>

<p>It was the young wife in Myra Bartrow, that
precious bit of clay as yet plastic under the hand of
the master-potter, that prompted the steadfast reply.</p>

<p>"If I loved him as I ought, I should pray God to
make me unselfish enough to say yes, Connie."</p>

<p>"So should I," said Constance simply; and Myra
made the lighting of the lamp an excuse for the
diversion which the three soft-spoken words demanded.
And when she went back to the matter of
fact, she touched lightly upon what she conceived to
be a wound yet far from healing.</p>

<p>"You have silenced me, Connie, but I can at least
provide for the contingency. If the event shapes
itself so that you are free to come to us, don't let
Margaret stand in the way. Bring her with you,
and we'll find room and work for her."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p>Connie's eyes were shining, but there was a loving
smile struggling with the tears. "I said you were
good, like Dick, Myra, dear, and I can't put it any
stronger. If I don't take you at your word, it will
not be for anything you have left unsaid. Isn't
that Dick coming?"</p>

<p>It was. There was a double step in the corridor,
and Bartrow came in with Stephen Elliott. Since
the battle persuasive with the daughter had kept her
single-eyed, Myra had had but brief glimpses of the
father during the day; but now she remarked that
his step was a little less firmly planted than it had
been in that holiday time when he had played the
unwonted part of escort in ordinary to two young
women who had dragged him whither they would,&mdash;and
whither he would not. Moreover, there was
the look of the burden-bearer in his eyes, though
their fire was undimmed; and an air of belated
sprightliness in his manner which went near to
Myra's heart, because she knew it came of conscious
effort. These jottings and others, the added stoop
of the shoulders, and the lagging half-step to the
rear in entering, as of one who may no longer keep
pace with younger men, Myra made while Dick was
timing the dash for their train.</p>

<p>"Thirty-five minutes more, and we'll quit you,&mdash;say,
Uncle Steve, that clock of yours is slow,&mdash;that's
half an hour for supper, and five minutes for
the yum-yums at the car-step. Gear yourselves, you
two, and we'll all go and make a raid on the supper-room
at the station."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p>"Indeed, we sha'n't," said Connie, in hospitable
protest. "You are going to eat bread and butter
and drink strong tea on the top floor of the Thorson
Block. I've had the water cooking for an hour, and
you sha'n't make me waste gasoline in any such way."</p>

<p>Dick would have argued the point with her; was,
in fact, beginning the counter-protest, when Myra
stopped him.'</p>

<p>"Of course we'll stay," she assented. "You go
with Connie and help make the tea, Dick. I haven't
begun to have a visit with Uncle Stephen yet."</p>

<p>Bartrow gave up the fight and was led captive of
the small one to the room across the corridor which
served as a kitchen. Left alone with his sister's
daughter, Stephen Elliott had a sudden return of the
haltingnesses which the Philadelphia niece, newly
arrived, used to inspire; but Myra asked only for
an acquiescent listener.</p>

<p>"Uncle Stephen," she began, pinning him in the
lounge-corner from which there was no possibility of
escape, "I've been wanting to get at you all day, and
I was afraid you weren't going to give me a chance.
You have 'grub-staked' a lot of people, first and
last, haven't you?"</p>

<p>The old man eyed her suspiciously for a moment,
and then evidently banished the suspicion as a thing
unworthy.</p>

<p>"Why, yes; I have staked a good few of them,
first and last, as you say."</p>

<p>"I knew it, and I wanted to ask a question. How
much money did you usually give them?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>

<p>The suspicion was well lulled by this; and finding
himself upon familiar ground, the pioneer went into
details.</p>

<p>"That depended a good deal upon the other fellow.
Some of them&mdash;most of 'em, I was going to say&mdash;couldn't
be trusted with money at all, and I'd go
buy them an outfit and stay with them till they got
out o' range of the saloons and green tables."</p>

<p>"But when you found one whom you could trust,
how much money did you give him? I'm not idly
curious; I know a man who wants to go prospecting,
and I have promised to 'stake' him."</p>

<p>The suspicion raised its head again, and was
promptly clubbed into submission. Some one of
the Myriad men wanted to try his luck, and he had
"braced" the wife rather than the husband. So
thought the pioneer, and made answer accordingly.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't monkey with it, if I were you, Myra;
leastwise, not without letting Dick into it. He's
right on the ground, and he'll tell you how much
you'd ought to put up; or&mdash;what's more likely&mdash;if
you oughtn't to tell the fellow to stick to his day-pay
in the mine."</p>

<p>"Dick knows," said Myra, anticipating the exact
truth by some brief hour or so, "and he's quite
willing. But you know Dick; if I should leave it
with him he would give the man all he had and go
and borrow for himself. I want a good sober conservative
opinion,&mdash;not too conservative, you know,
but just about what you would need if you were going
out yourself."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>

<p>Elliott became dubitantly reflective, being divided
between a desire to spare Myra's purse and a disposition
born of fellow-feelings to make it as easy as
might be for the unknown beneficiary.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," he said, at length. "If
the fellow is going by himself, he won't need much;
but if he takes a partner it'll just about double the
stake. Is he going to play it alone?"</p>

<p>Myra could see through the open door into the
adjoining room, and she saw Connie bringing in
the tea. Time was growing precious, if the conclusion
were not to be tripped up by an interruption.</p>

<p>"I suppose he'll take a partner; they always do,
don't they? Anyway, I want to make it enough so
that he can if he chooses. Please tell me how
much."</p>

<p>"Well, if he knows how to cut the corners and
how to outfit so as to make the most of what he has,
he'd ought to be able to do it on a couple of hundred
or so. But I don't know if that ain't pretty
liberal," he added, as if upon second thought.</p>

<p>Myra went quickly to the table under the lamp,
and wrote upon a slip of paper. Elliott thought
she was making a note of her information; and
when she put the check into his hands he took it
mechanically. But her hurried explanation drove
the firing-pin of intelligence.</p>

<p>"It's for you&mdash;you are the man, Uncle Stephen;
and if it isn't enough, it's your own fault." She
said it with one eye on the two in the next room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
and with nerves taut-braced for the shock of refusal.
The shock came promptly.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;say&mdash;here! Myra, girl; I can't take
this from you!" He was on his feet, trying to give
back the check; and as she eluded him he followed
her about the room, protesting as he went. "It's
just like you to offer it, but I can't, don't you see?
I'll rope somebody else in; somebody that knows
the chances. Here, take it back,&mdash;I'm getting
pretty old, and just as like as not I won't find
anything worth assaying. Come, now; you be a
good girl, and"&mdash;</p>

<p>He had driven her into a corner, and it was time
for the <i>coup de main</i>. So she put her arms about
his neck and her face on his shoulder, and if the
attack pathetic were no more than a clever bit of
feigning, Stephen Elliott was none the wiser.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I'd like to know what I have done!" she
quavered. "You'd take it from a stranger&mdash;you
said you would&mdash;and you've made me just the
same as your own daughter, and now you wo&mdash;won't
let me do the first little thing I've ever had a
chance to do!"</p>

<p>There were more strong solvents of a similar
nature in reserve, but they were not needed. The
good old man was helplessly soluble in any woman's
tears, real or invented; and his fine resolution
melted and the bones of it became as water.</p>

<p>"There, there, little girl, don't you take on like
that. I'll keep it. See? I've chucked it right
down into the bottom of my pocket"&mdash;he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
stroking her hair and otherwise gentling her as if
she were a hurt child. "Don't you fret a little bit.
I'll spend it&mdash;every last cent of it&mdash;just the way
you want me to. You mustn't cry another tear;
Dick'll think I've been abusing you, and he'll fire
the old uncle out of one of these high windows.
Haven't you got any handkerchief?"</p>

<p>Connie and Dick were at the door, announcing
the bread and butter and tea, and Myra's handkerchief
became a convenient mask for the moment.
A less simple-hearted man than the old pioneer
might have suspected the sincerity of such tears as
may be wiped away at a word, leaving no trace
behind them; but Elliott was too child-like to know
aught of the fine art of dissimulation, and he took
Myra's sudden return to cheerfulness as a tribute to
his own astuteness in yielding a point at the critical
moment.</p>

<p>At the tea-table they were all more or less hilarious,
each having somewhat to conceal from the
others; and even Bartrow was made to feel the
thinness of the ice upon which the trivialities were
skating. Much to Connie's surprise, the tactless
one developed unsuspected resources of adroitness
in keeping the table-talk at concert-pitch of levity;
and she forgave him when he was brutal enough to
make a jest of the simple meal, giving the bread
and butter a new name with each asking, and accusing
her of being in league with the commissary
department of the sleeping-car company. It spoke
volumes for Dick's growth in perspicacity that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
was able to discern the keen edge of the crisis
without having actually seen the stone upon which
it had been whetted; and in the midst of her own
fencings with the tensities, Constance found time to
wonder how Myra had wrought even the beginning
of such a miracle in the downright one.</p>

<p>In such resolute ignorings of the moving realities
the supper interval was safely outworn; but when,
at the end of it, Dick dragged out his watch and
called "time," Constance found her tea too hot,
and the drinking of it brought tears to her eyes.
Whereupon the brutal one made an exaggerated
pretense of sympathy, offering her a handkerchief;
and the laugh saved them all until the good-bys
were said, and the guests, with Elliott to speed their
parting, had gone to the station.</p>

<p>Constance stood in the empty corridor until the
farther stair ceased to echo their footsteps. The
day-long strain was off at last, and she meant to go
quickly and clear off the table and wash the supper
dishes, to the end that the reaction might not overwhelm
her. But on the way she stopped at the
little square table in the larger room and took a
letter from its hiding place at the back of a framed
photograph. It was a double inclosure in an outside
envelope which bore the business card of a well
known legal firm; and the wrapping of the inner
envelope was a note on the firm's letter-head, stating
in terse phrase that the inclosed letter had been
found under the door of an unoccupied house in
Colfax Avenue by the writer in the early summer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
of the previous year; that it had been mislaid; and
that it was now forwarded with many regrets for its
unintentional suppression.</p>

<p>Constance read the note mechanically, as she had
read it the day before when the postman had
brought it. It explained nothing more than the
mere fact of delay, but she understood. The writer
of the lost letter, or his messenger, had thrust it
under the door of the wrong house.</p>

<p>She laid the note aside and tilted the envelope to
let a coin fall into her palm. It was a double-eagle
piece, little worn, but the memories which clustered
about its giving and taking seemed to dull the lustre
of the yellow metal. It was the price of sorrowful
humiliation, no whit less to the man who had
taken than to the woman who had given it. She
put it that way in an inflexible determination to be
just. Truly, his acceptance of it was a thing to be
remembered with cheek-burnings of shame; but she
would not hold herself blameless. In the light of
that which his letter disclosed, her charitable impulse
became a sword to slay the last remnant of
manly pride and self-respect&mdash;if any remnant there
were.</p>

<p>She opened the letter and re-read it to the end,
going back from the scarcely legible signature to a
paragraph in the midst of it that bade fair to grave
itself ineffaceably upon her heart.</p>

<p>"You may remember that I said I couldn't tell
you the truth, because it concerns a woman. When
I add that the woman is yourself, you will understand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
I love you; I think I have been loving you
ever since that evening which you said we were
to forget&mdash;the evening at the theatre. Strangely
enough, my love for you isn't strong in the strength
which saves. I went from you that night when
you had bidden me God-speed at Mrs. Calmaine's,
and within the hour I was once more a penniless
vagabond.</p>

<p>"When you were trying to help me this afternoon,
I was trying to keep from saying that which
I could never have a right to say. You pressed me
very hard in your sweet innocence"....</p>

<p>She sat down and the letter slipped from her
fingers. The hurt was a year in the past, but time
had not yet dulled the pain of it. Not to any
human soul, nor yet to her own heart, had she
admitted the one living fact which stood unshaken;
which would stand, like some polished corner-stone
of a ruined temple, when all else should have
crumbled into dust. For which cause she sat with
clasped hands and eyes that saw not; eyes that
were still deep wells and clear, but brimming with
the bitter waters of a fountain which flows only for
those whose loss is irreparable. And while she wept,
the sorrowful under-thought slipped into speech.</p>

<p>"He calls it love, but it couldn't have been that.
He says it wasn't strong in the strength that saves;
and love is always mighty to succor the weak-hearted.
I would have believed in him&mdash;I did
believe in him, only I didn't know how to help.
But no one could help when he didn't believe in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
himself; and now he is just drifting, with the cruel
sword of opportunity loose in its scabbard, and all
the unspeakable things dragging him whithersoever
they will.... And he meant to end it all when
he wrote this letter; I know he did. That would
have been terrible; but it would have been braver
than to go on to robbery, and unfaith, and&mdash;and
now to this last pitiless iniquity. Oh, I can't let it
go on to that!&mdash;not if I have to go and plead with
him for the sake of that which he once thought
was&mdash;love." She went down upon her knees with
her face hidden in the chair-cushion, and the unconscious
monologue became a passionate beseeching:
"O God, help me to be strong and steadfast, that
I may not fail when I come to stand between these
two; for Thou knowest the secrets of the heart and
all its weakness; and Thou knowest"&mdash;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Bartrows, with Stephen Elliott to expedite
their outsetting, caught their train with nothing to
spare; and while the goggle-eyed switch-lamps were
still flashing past the windows of the sleeping-car,
Myra settled herself comfortably in her corner of
the section and demanded the day's accounting.</p>

<p>Bartrow was rummaging in the hand-bag for his
traveling-cap, and he looked up with a most transparent
affectation of surprise.</p>

<p>"Hah? Wasn't I supposed to be chasing around
all day trying to buy a rock-drill?"</p>

<p>Myra ignored the skilless parry and thrust home.
"Don't tease," she said. "You did beautifully at
the supper-table, and I am quite sure Connie didn't
suspect. But I want to know what has happened."</p>

<p>Bartrow laughed good-naturedly. "Same old
window-pane for you to look through, am I not?
It's lucky for me that I'm a rattling good fellow,
with nothing particular inside of me to be ashamed
of." He was thumbing a collection of pocket-worn
papers, and presently handed her a crisp bill of
exchange for five hundred and forty-five dollars.
"What do you think of that for one of the happenings!"</p>

<p>She read the figure of it and the date. "I don't
understand," she said. "Where did you get it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<p>"You wouldn't guess in a thousand years. It's
the money I borrowed for Jeffard one fine morning
last fall, with bank interest to date."</p>

<p>"Then you have seen him?"</p>

<p>"Saw him, felt of his hand, and went to luncheon
with him."</p>

<p>"Dick! And you really had the courage to ask
him for this?"</p>

<p>Bartrow's smile was a grimace. "Don't you sit
there and tempt me to lie about it. You know
what a fool I am with a debtor. Fortunately, I
didn't have to ask; it came about as most things do
in this world&mdash;click! buzz! boom! and your infernal
machine has exploded. We cannoned against
each other as I was going into the bank to get the
money for the machinery man. After we'd said
'Hello,' and shook hands, Jeffard went in with me.
On the way out the cashier stopped us. 'Mr. Jeffard,'
says he, 'your personal account has a credit
of five hundred dollars which doesn't appear in the
deposits. If you'll let me have your book I'll
enter it.' 'A credit?&mdash;of five hundred dollars?
I don't understand,' says Jeffard. 'It's all right,'
says the cashier. 'It came from the Carbonate
City National, in Leadville. Didn't they notify
you?' 'No,' says Jeffard; 'it must be a mistake.
I had no credit in Leadville.' All this time the
cashier was digging into his pigeonholes. 'You
must have had,' says he. 'I can't put my hand on
their letter, but as I recall it, they said the money
was a remittance made by you sometime last year to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
cover a promissory note. When it reached them the
note had matured and had been lifted. They have
kept your money a good while, but they claim not
to have known your address.'"</p>

<p>Myra was listening with something more than
curiosity.</p>

<p>"What did Mr. Jeffard say?" she asked.</p>

<p>"He looked a good deal more than he said; and
what he said was rather queer. When he had
pulled me a little aside, he lit a cigar and offered
me one, as cool as ice. 'Of course, you'll understand
that this was all prearranged between Mr.
Holburn and myself,' says he. 'It would be too
great a tax upon your credulity to ask you to
believe that it is merely a coincidence; that I really
did send the money to the Leadville bank to lift
that note months ago.' I said No, and meant it;
and he went over to the exchange window and made
out a check and bought that draft. But afterward
I could have kicked him for making that
suggestion. I couldn't break away from it to save
my life, and it stuck to me straight through to the
finish."</p>

<p>"But you went to luncheon with him afterward.
Didn't he explain?"</p>

<p>"Not a word. I tried my level best to pull the
thing out of the hole two or three times, but it was
buried too deep for me. And somehow that idiotic
sneer of his seemed to color everything he said.
He seemed to take it for granted that I'd been setting
him down all these months for a scalawag, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
everything I could say got twisted into a slap. We
worried through the meal, and the cigars after it,
in some sort of thankless fashion; but I wouldn't
do it again for a farm."</p>

<p>Myra became reflectively thoughtful, and with the
jarring of the car the bit of money paper fell to the
floor. Dick recovered it, put it away, and waited
patiently for her comment. When it came it was
no more than a leading question.</p>

<p>"What do you make of it, Dick?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what to make of it. If I could
break away from all the things I used to know
about him, I should say he acts like a man who has
done something to make him declare war upon
himself, and&mdash;as a natural consequence&mdash;upon
everybody else. He seems to be ready to fight at
the drop of the hat, and that's a bad symptom."</p>

<p>"It is a symptom of a guilty conscience, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>Bartrow did not answer at once. To speak by
the fact was to admit that all his loyal upholdings
of Jeffard had been spent upon an unworthy object,
and he was reluctant in just proportion to his loyalty.
But the fact was large&mdash;too large to be
overleaped.</p>

<p>"It is a symptom, yes; and I'm beginning to be
afraid it's a true one in Jeffard's case. I didn't
find a soft spot in him anywhere till we came to
speak of Lansdale."</p>

<p>"They are still friends?"</p>

<p>"Y&mdash;es, in a way; a sort of give-and-take way.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
Lansdale is cool and pretty well-calculated in his
friendships as in everything else; and I imagine he
forgathers with Jeffard without prejudice to his
own private convictions in the Garvin affair. It's
a bit odd, but Jeffard seems to have most of the remembrances
on his side."</p>

<p>"The kindly ones, you mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I hadn't seen Lansdale yet, and I asked
Jeffard how he was looking. He wagged his head,
and there was a look in his eyes that I'd seen there
more than once in the old days. 'Unless there is
something to be done more than has been tried, it's
only a question of weeks,' said he; and then he
went back to something I had said that morning in
Leadville just before he climbed the engine for the
race to Aspen."</p>

<p>Myra's eyebrows arched a query, and he elucidated.</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you? We had been talking about
Connie, and I had hinted that she'd be willing to
buy health for Lansdale at a price; and he"&mdash;</p>

<p>Myra cut in swiftly. "Has she told you that,
Dick?"</p>

<p>"Hardly; but I've eyes, haven't I? Well, as
I was saying, Jeffard went back to that, and asked
if Lansdale's recovery still meant as much to Connie.
I told him I thought it meant rather more
than less; and then he went into his shell, and
when he came out it was on the human side. Said
he had money to burn now, and asked if there was
anything anybody could do to give Lansdale a better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
show for his white alley. I told him what I'd
do if I could break away from the Myriad."</p>

<p>"I remember; you said you would take him
afield."</p>

<p>"Yes. Rig up a team and a camping outfit, and
chase him out into the mountains. Make him live
outdoors for a month or two, and belt him over the
head if I ever caught him sharpening a lead pencil.
He's grinding away with Kershaw nights and Sundays,
and trying to write a novel between times.
It's a clear case of work-to-death."</p>

<p>Myra nodded. "I think so; I have thought so
all along. But he wouldn't go with Mr. Jeffard."</p>

<p>"That's what I thought, and what I told Jeffard
when he hinted at the thing. But we were both off;
and that brings me to the other happening. After
we'd smoked over it&mdash;Jeffard and I&mdash;we went
around and hunted up Lansdale's doctor. The
medicine-man agreed with me that it was the only
chance, but he didn't give us much encouragement.
Said it was a forlorn hope, with the odds against
Lansdale; that he'd die if he didn't go, and would
probably die if he did. Jeffard had been in and
out of his shell two or three times since the beginning
of it, but he came out again at that and stayed
out. Said he owed Lansdale, and that would be
a good way to wipe out the account. I told him
that wouldn't go; that if he wanted to do Lansdale
a good turn, he'd have to do it on its merits. 'I
sha'n't be such a fool as to tell Lansdale I'm trying
to square up with him,' says he. 'You go
and persuade him.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<p>Myra's hand was on his knee. "You poor boy!"
she said; "they always unload the thankless things
on you, don't they? Did you try?"</p>

<p>"Sure. If I'd felt like hanging back, a sight
of Lansdale would have done the business for me.
It's awful, little woman. I've seen dead men, and
men that were going to die, but never a dying one
that wanted so hard to live. Of course, he kicked
clear over the traces when I proposed it, though I
lied like a whitehead, and tried to make him believe
it was my scheme to help Jeffard get cured of
his case of mental and moral 'jimmies.' When
that failed, I dug right down to hard-pan. 'You
want to live, don't you?' said I, and when he admitted
it, I biffed him square on the point of the
jaw. Says I, 'Then it's a question of your stiff-necked
New England pride against your love for a
little girl who would give her right hand to see you
well and strong, is it? You're not as good a man
as I thought you were.'"</p>

<p>Myra was moved to protest. "Oh, Dick! I do
hope you haven't taken too much for granted! But
go on; what did he say?"</p>

<p>"I thought he'd rise up and fall on me at first;
but he didn't. He mumbled something about the
'precious balms of a friend breaking his head,' and
said I was altogether mistaken; that Connie was
only an angel of mercy, one of God's little ones, and
a few other things of that sort."</p>

<p>"'Only'!" laughed Myra.</p>

<p>"Yes, 'only.' But I could see that my shoulder-blow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
had knocked him out. He switched the talk
to Jeffard, and pretty soon he was asking me if I
really thought he could do any good in that quarter;
or if my saying so was merely a lie cut out of whole
cloth. I was soaked through by that time, and
another plunge more or less didn't cut any figure,
so I told him it wasn't a lie; that there was still
hope for Jeffard if any one would lay hold of him
and stick to him. 'What kind of hope, Dick?'
says he. And I said, 'The only kind that counts;
the kind that'll make him all through what he is in
part.' He shook his head at that, and said, 'I don't
know. That would mean repentance and restitution,&mdash;and
the money's got its teeth into him now.'
I'll have to admit that I was arguing dead against
the probabilities, and I knew it; but I wouldn't let
go."</p>

<p>Myra's smile was tempered with affectionate pride.
"You never do let go. Did he finally listen to
reason?"</p>

<p>"Yes, at the end of it. But if it were six for
himself and Connie, it was a good half-dozen for
Jeffard. 'I'll go, Dick,' said he. 'I'm afraid
your assumptions are all good-hearted wishes, but
I'll go. Perhaps, if it comes to the worst, God will
give me a man for my leave-taking.' That was a
new side of him, to me; the Puritan side, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"The human side," she amended. "It is merely
crusted a little thicker in the Puritan family."</p>

<p>"But it's there, all the same. Out here, where
the horizons and other things are pretty wide open,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
we're apt to say what we think, and pretty much all
of it; but Lansdale and his kind think a good bit
more and keep it to themselves. He's all right.
I only wish his getting well were as sure as the
goodness of him. Are you getting sleepy? Want
your berth made down?"</p>

<p>"Presently." Myra was gazing out at the night-wall
slipping past the car windows, and for her the
thick blackness mirrored a picture of a sweet-faced
young woman sitting on a denim-covered lounge,
with her hands tight clasped over one knee and her
eyes alight with a soft starglow of compassion. And
because of the picture, she said: "I'm afraid you
didn't take too much for granted, Dick; and I
could almost wish it were otherwise. It is heart-breaking
to think of it."</p>

<p>Dick went over to a seat beside her, and tried to
put himself as nearly as possible at her point of view.</p>

<p>"Let's not try to cross their bridges for them
beforehand, little woman," he said, with his lips at
her ear. "Life is pretty middling full for all of us,&mdash;for
us two, at any rate."</p>

<p>It was five minutes later, and the train had stopped
for orders at the canyon gateway, when she turned
to him to say: "What do you think about Mr.
Jeffard now, Dick? Are we all mistaken? or is he
the hardened cynic he seems to be?"</p>

<p>Bartrow did not reply on the spur of the moment,
as was his custom. When he had reasoned it out,
he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I think we ought to break away from the notion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
that a man has got to be either all angel or all
devil. Jeffard's a human man, like the rest of us.
He's done some good things that I know of,&mdash;and
one pretty bad one; and it's the bad one that is
setting the pace for him just now. But, as I once
said to Lansdale, I'm betting on the finish. One
bad curve needn't spoil a whole railroad."</p>

<p>Myra's hand sought and found his under cover of
her wrap. "You are loyalty itself, Dick, and I
can't help loving you for it. But you say 'one bad
one.' Have you forgotten the Irish girl?"</p>

<p>Dick set his jaw at that, and the big hand closed
firmly over the small one.</p>

<p>"When I have to believe that of him, Myra, my
faith in my kind will drop back more notches than
one. That would make him all devil, don't you
see?"</p>

<p>But her charity outran his. "No, Dick; I don't
quite see it. It is just one more coil in the puzzle-tangle
of good and evil that you spoke of. Connie
knows it, and if she can find it in her heart to forgive
him"&mdash;</p>

<p>There was reverent awe in Bartrow's rejoinder.
"Do you mean to say she'd forgive him&mdash;<i>that</i>?"</p>

<p>The intermittent clatter and roar of the canyon
climb had begun, and in one of the breathing spaces
Myra made answer.</p>

<p>"She is one of God's little ones, as Mr. Lansdale
said. I think she would forgive him even that."
And in the next gap in the clamor, "Did you tell
him about Garvin?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<p>Dick shook his head. "No, I didn't dare to.
It's a hard thing to say, but I'm not sure he
wouldn't prosecute Jim for the attempt to kill.
There's no such vindictiveness in the world as that
which dates back to benefits forgot. But I told
Lansdale, and gave him leave to make use of it if
the time should ever come when he could do it without
jeopardizing Garvin."</p>

<p>At which Myra's charity stumbled and fell and
ran no more.</p>

<p>"That time will never come, Dick. Mr. Jeffard
has a double feud with Garvin,&mdash;he is Garvin's
debtor for benefits forgot, as you say; and he has
done Garvin an injury. I am glad you didn't tell
him."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">She's</span> gone to her rest, at last, poor soul, and
it's happy she'd be if it wasn't for the childer."</p>

<p>Constance had been waiting through the long
hours of the afternoon for Margaret's return from
Owen David's shanty on the North Side; waiting
for the summons to the death-bed of the mother of
Owen David's children. She had promised to go,
wherefore her heart smote her and the ready tears
welled up at Margaret's announcement.</p>

<p>"Oh, Margaret! Why didn't you come for me!"</p>

<p>"'Twas no use at all, Miss Constance; 'twas
her last word she said to you this morning, when
she asked you to try once more with Owen for the
childer's sake. When you'd gone she turned her
face to the wall, and we never knew when her soul
went out."</p>

<p>"Was Owen there?"</p>

<p>"He was; and it's sober he was for the first time
in many a day. He took it hard; them Welsh are
flighty people, anyway."</p>

<p>"He ought to take it hard," said Constance, with
as near an approach to vindictiveness as the heart
of compassion would sanction. "Has everything
been done?"</p>

<p>Margaret nodded. "The neighbors were that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
kind; and it's poor hard-working people they are,
too."</p>

<p>"I know," said Constance. She was making
ready to go out, and she found her purse and
counted its keepings. They were as scanty as her
will to help was plenteous. Myra's check had been
generous, but the askings were many, and there was
no more than the sweet savor of it left. "I'm
sure I don't know what Owen will do," she went on.
"I suppose there isn't money enough to bury her."</p>

<p>Margaret had taken off her hat and jacket and
she was suddenly impelled to go to work. The
lounge-cover was awry, and in the straightening of
it she said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't you be worrying about that, now, Miss
Constance. It was Owen himself that was giving
me the money for the funeral when I was leaving."</p>

<p>"Owen? Where did he get it? He hasn't had
a day's work for a month."</p>

<p>Margaret was smoothing the cover and shaking
the pillows vigorously. "Sure, that's just what I
was thinking" (slap, slap), "but I've his money
in my pocket this blessed minute. So you just go
and say a sweet word to the childer, Miss Constance,
and don't you be worrying about anything."</p>

<p>Connie's hand was on the door-knob, but she
turned with a sudden sinking of the heart, and a
swift impulse that sent her across the room to Margaret's
side.</p>

<p>"Margaret, you gave Owen that money before he
gave it to you. Where did you get it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<p>Margaret left off beating the pillows and slipped
upon her knees to bury her face in one of them.</p>

<p>"I knew you'd be asking that," she sobbed, and
then: "Haven't I been working honest every day
since Christmas? And does it be taking all I earn
to keep me, I'd like to know?"</p>

<p>Constance went down on her knees beside the
girl, and what she said was to One who was merciful
even to the Magdalenes. When she rose the
pain of it was a little dulled, and she went back to
the charitable necessities in a word.</p>

<p>"Is there any one to watch with her to-night,
Margaret?"</p>

<p>The girl lifted a tear-stained face, and the passionate
Irish eyes were swimming, and Constance
turned away because her loving compassion was
greater than her determination to be judicially
severe.</p>

<p>"I'm one," Margaret answered; "and Mrs.
Mulcahey'll come over when her man gets home."</p>

<p>"Very well. I'll go over and give the children
their suppers and put them to bed. I'll stay till
you come, and you can bring Tommie to take me
home."</p>

<p>Constance went upon her mission heavy-hearted;
and in the hovel across the river found comfort in
the giving of comfort. The David children were
all little ones, too young to fully realize their loss;
and when they had been fed and hushed to sleep,
and one of David's fellow workmen had taken the
husband away for the night, Constance sat down in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
the room with the dead to wait for Margaret. For
a heart less pitiful or a soul less steadfast, the
silence of the night and the solitary watch with the
sheeted figure on the bed might have been unnerving;
but in all her life Constance had never had to
reckon with fear. Hence, when the door opened
behind her without a preliminary knock, and a footstep
crossed the threshold, she thought it was one
of the neighbors and rose softly with her finger on
her lip. But when she saw who it was, she started
back and made as if she would retreat to the room
where the children were.</p>

<p>"You!" she said. "Why are you here?"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon." Jeffard said it deferentially,
almost humbly. "I didn't expect to find
you here; I was looking for&mdash;for the man, you
know. What has become of him?"</p>

<p>The hesitant pause in the midst of the explanation
opened the door for a swift suspicion,&mdash;a suspicion
too horrible to be entertained, and yet too strong
to be driven forth. There was righteous indignation
in her eyes when she went close to him and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Can you stand here in the presence of that"&mdash;pointing
to the sheeted figure on the bed&mdash;"and
lie to me? You expected to meet Margaret Gannon
here. You have made an appointment with
her&mdash;an assignation in the house of the dead.
Shame on you!"</p>

<p>It should have crushed him. It did for the
moment. And when he rallied it was apparently
in a spirit of the sheerest hardihood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are right," he said; "I did expect to meet
Margaret. With your permission, I'll go outside
and wait for her."</p>

<p>She flashed between him and the door and put
her back to it.</p>

<p>"Not until you have heard what I have to say,
Mr. Jeffard. I've been wanting to say it ever since
Tommie told me, but you have been very careful not
to give me a chance. You know this girl's story,
and what she has had to fight from day to day.
Are you so lost to every sense of justice and mercy
as to try to drag her back into sin and shame after
all her pitiful strugglings?"</p>

<p>"It would seem so," Jeffard retorted, and his
smile was harder than his words. "It is quite conceivable
that you should believe it of the man who
once took your charity and made a mock of it.
May I go now?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, not yet; not until you have promised
me to spare and slay not, for this once. Think of
it a moment; it is the price of a human soul! And
it is such a little thing for you to concede."</p>

<p>The hard smile came and went again.</p>

<p>"Another man might say that Margaret has come
to be very beautiful, Miss Elliott."</p>

<p>The indignation was gone out of her eyes, and her
lips were trembling.</p>

<p>"Oh, how can you be so hard!" she faltered.
"Will nothing move you?"</p>

<p>He met the beseeching with a steady gaze that
might have been the outlooking of a spirit of calm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
superiority or the cold stare of a demon of ruthlessness.
The mere suggestion of the alternative made
her hot and cold by turns.</p>

<p>"I wonder that you have the courage to appeal to
me," he said, at length. "Are you not afraid?"</p>

<p>"For Margaret's sake I am not afraid."</p>

<p>"You are very brave&mdash;and very loyal. Do you
wonder that I was once moved to tell you that I
loved you?"</p>

<p>"How can you speak of that here&mdash;and now!"
she burst out. "Is there no measure of the hardness
of your heart? Is it not enough that you
should make me beg for that which I have a right
to demand?"</p>

<p>He went apart from her at that to walk softly up
and down in the narrow space between the bed and
the wall,&mdash;to walk for leaden-winged minutes that
seemed hours to Constance, waiting for his answer.
At the final turn he lifted the sheet from the face of
the dead woman and looked long and earnestly, as
one who would let death speak where life was dumb
and inarticulate. Constance watched him with her
heart in a turmoil of doubt and fear. The doubt was
of her own making, as the fear was of his. She had
thought that this man was known to her, in his potentialities
for good or evil, in his stumblings upon the
brink of the abyss, and in his later plunge into the
depths of wrongdoing; but now that she was brought
face to face with him, her prefigurings took new
shapes and she feared to look upon them. For the
potentialities had suddenly become superhuman, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
love itself stood aghast at the possibilities. In the
midst of it he stood before her again.</p>

<p>"What is it that you would have me do?" he
asked.</p>

<p>The tone of it assured her that her battle was
fought and won; but at the moment of victory she
had not the strength to make terms with him.</p>

<p>"You know what you ought to do," she said, with
eyes downcast.</p>

<p>"The 'oughts' are sometimes terribly hard, Miss
Elliott. Haven't you found them so?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes." She was finding one of them
sufficiently hard at that moment to compel the admission.</p>

<p>"But they are never impossible, you would say,
and that is true also. You asked me a few moments
ago if there was nothing that would move me, and I
was tempted. But that is past. Will you suffer me
to go now?"</p>

<p>She stood aside, but her hand was still on the
latch of the door.</p>

<p>"You have not promised," she said.</p>

<p>"Pardon me; I was hoping you would spare me.
The cup is of my own mixing, but the lees are bitter.
Must I drain them?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't understand," she rejoined.</p>

<p>"Don't you? Consider it a moment. You have
taken it for granted that I had it in my heart to do
this thing, and, knowing what you do of me, the inference
is just. But I have not admitted it, and I
had hoped you would spare me the admission which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
a promise would imply. Won't you leave me this
poor shadow of refutation?"</p>

<p>She opened the door for him.</p>

<p>"Thank you; it is much more than I deserve.
Since you do not ask it, you shall have the assurance,&mdash;the
best I can give. I shall leave Denver in a
day or two, and you may take your own measures
for safeguarding Margaret in the interval. Perhaps
it won't be as difficult as you may imagine.
If I have read her aright you may ask large things
of her loyalty and devotion to you."</p>

<p>The battle was over, and she had but to hold her
peace to be quit of him. But having won her cause
it was not in the loving heart of her to let him go
unrecompensed.</p>

<p>"You are going away? Then we may not meet
again. I gave you bitter words a few minutes ago,
Mr. Jeffard, but I believed they were true. Won't
you deny them&mdash;if you can?"</p>

<p>His foot was across the threshold, but he turned
to smile down upon her.</p>

<p>"You are a true woman. You said I lied to you,
and now you ask me to deny it, knowing well enough
that the denial will afterward stand for another
falsehood. I know what you think of me,&mdash;what
you are bound to think of me; but isn't it conceivable
that I would rather quench that fire than add
fuel to it?"</p>

<p>"But you are going away," she insisted.</p>

<p>"And since we may never meet again, you crave
the poor comfort of a denial. You shall have it for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
what it is worth. When you are inclined to think
charitably of me, go back to first principles and remember
that the worst of men have sometimes had
promptings which were not altogether unworthy.
Let the major accusation stand, if you choose; I
did have an appointment here with Margaret Gannon.
But when your faith in humankind needs
heartening, conceive that for this once the tryst was
one which any woman might have kept with me.
Believe, if you care to, that my business here this
evening was really with this poor fellow whose sins
have found him out. Would you like to be able to
believe that?"</p>

<p>For the first time since doubt and fear had gotten
the better of indignation she was able to lift her eyes
to his.</p>

<p>"I will believe it," she said gratefully.</p>

<p>He smiled again, and she was no longer afraid.
Now that she came to think of it, she wondered if
she had ever been really afraid of him.</p>

<p>"Your faith is very beautiful, Miss Elliott. I
am glad to be able to give it something better than
a bare suggestion to build on. Will you give this
to Margaret when she comes?"</p>

<p>It was a folded paper, with a printed title and indorsement
blanks on the back. She took it and
glanced at the filing. It was the deed to a burial
lot in the name of Owen David.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she said; and there was a world of contrition
and self-reproach in the single word. "Can
you ever forgive me, Mr. Jeffard?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>

<p>As once before, when Lansdale had proffered it,
Jeffard pushed aside the cup of reinstatement.</p>

<p>"Don't take too much for granted. Remember,
the indictment still stands. Margaret Gannon's
tempter might have done this and still merit your
detestation."</p>

<p>And at the word she was once more alone with
the still figure on the bed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> what reason Constance, left alone in the
house of the dead, went softly from the lighted
room to kneel at the bedside of the sleeping children
in the lean-to beyond&mdash;to kneel with her face
in her hands and her heart swelling with emotions
too great for any outlet save that of sorrowful beseechings,&mdash;let
those adjudge who have passed in
some crucial moment from loss to gain, and back
to loss again. There was a pitiful heart cry in the
prayer for help because she knew now that love,
mighty and unreasoning, must be reckoned with in
every future thought of this man; love heedless of
consequences, clinging first to an imagined ideal, and
now to the sorrowful wreck of that ideal; love
lashed into being, it may be, by the very whip of
shame, acknowledged only to be chained and dungeoned
in the Castle of Despair, but alive and
pleading, and promising yet to live and plead
though hope were dead.</p>

<p>It was thus that Margaret found her an hour
later; and in the darkness of the little room the
true-hearted Irish girl knelt beside her saint, with
her strong arms around the weeping one, and a sob
of precious sympathy in the outpouring of words.</p>

<p>"There now&mdash;there now, Miss Constance! is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
it kneeling here and crying for these poor left ones
that you are? Sure it's the Holy Virgin herself
that'll be mothering them, and the likes of them.
And Owen'll be doing his part, too. It's a
changed man he is."</p>

<p>Constance shook her head. She was too sincere
to let the lesser reason stand for the greater, even
with Margaret.</p>

<p>"I do grieve for them, Margaret; but&mdash;but it
isn't that."</p>

<p>"It isn't that, do you say? Then I know full
well what it is, and it's the truth I'm going to tell
you, Miss Constance, for all the promisings he made
me give him. 'Tis Mr. Jeffard's money that's to
go for the funeral, and it was him left it with me to
give to Owen. He told me you'd not take it from
him, and 'twas his own free gift. Ever since he
came back he's been giving me money for the poor
ones, and making me swear never to tell you; but it
was for your sweet sake, Miss Connie, and not for
mine. I'd want to die if you didn't believe that."</p>

<p>"Oh, Margaret! are you telling me the truth?
I do so want to believe it!"</p>

<p>Margaret rose and drew her confessor to the half-open
door; to the bedside of the sheeted one.</p>

<p>"A little while ago she was alive and talking to
you, Miss Constance, and you believed her because
you knew she was going fast. If I'd be like that,
I'd tell you the same."</p>

<p>"I believe you, Margaret&mdash;I do believe you;
and, oh, I'm <i>so</i> thankful! It would break my
heart to have you go back now!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't you be worrying for me. Didn't I say
once that the devil might fly away with me, but I'd
not live to leave him have the good of it? When
that time comes, Miss Constance, it's another dead
woman you'll be crying over. And now you'll go
home and take your rest; the good old father is
waiting on the doorstep for you."</p>

<p>Even with his daughter, Stephen Elliott was the
most reticent of men; and on the little journey up
the river front and across the viaduct he plodded
along in silence beside her, waiting for her to speak
if she had anything to say. Constance had a heart
full to overflowing, but not of the things which lend
themselves to speech with any father; and when she
broke the silence it was in self-defense, and on the
side of the commonplace.</p>

<p>"Have you decided yet where you will go?"
she asked, knowing that the arrangements for the
prospecting trip were all but completed.</p>

<p>"N&mdash;no, not exactly. Except that I never have
gone with the rush, and I don't mean to this time.
There's some pretty promising country around up
back of Dick's mountain, and I've been thinking of
that."</p>

<p>"I wish you would go into the Bonanza district,"
she said. "If I'm to stay with Dick and Myra,
it will be a comfort to know that you are not very
far away."</p>

<p>The old man plodded another square before he
succeeded in casting his thought into words.</p>

<p>"I was wondering if that wasn't the reason why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
I want to go there. I'm not letting on to anybody
about it, but I'm getting sort of old and trembly,
Connie; and you're about all I have left."</p>

<p>She slipped her arm an inch or two farther
through his. "Must it be, poppa? Can't we get
along without it? I'll be glad to live like the
poorest of them, if we can only be together."</p>

<p>"I know; you're a good daughter to me, Connie,
and you'd go into the hospital on Dr. Gordon's
offer to-morrow, if I'd say the word. But I think
the last strike I made rather spoiled me. I got
sort of used to the flesh-pots, and I haven't got
over feeling for my check-book yet. I guess I'll
have to try it once more before we go on the
county."</p>

<p>She would have said more had there been more
to say. But her arguments had all been exhausted
when the prospecting fever had set in, and she
could only send him forth with words of heartening
and a brave God-speed.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to put things in the way," she
said; "but I'd go with you and help dig, if you'd
let me. The next best thing will be to have you
somewhere within reach, and I shall be comforted
if you can manage to keep Topeka Mountain in
sight. But you won't."</p>

<p>"Yes, I will, daughter; the string pulls about
as hard at my end as it does at yours, and I'll tell
you what I'll do. The gulches that I had in mind
are all up at the head of Myriad Creek, and I'll
ship the 'stake' to Dick, and make the Myriad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
a sort of outfitting camp. How will that strike
you?"</p>

<p>"That will be fine," she said; adding, in an upflash
of the old gayety: "and when you've located
your claim, Myra and I will come and turn the
windlass for you."</p>

<p>They were climbing the stairs to the darkened
suite on the third floor, and at the door Constance
found a telegraph messenger trying to pin a non-delivery
notice to the panel. She signed his blank
by the hall light, and read the message while her
father was unlocking the door and lighting the
lamp.</p>

<p>"It is from Myra," she explained; "and it's
good news and bad. Do you remember what Dick
was telling us the other evening about his drunken
blacksmith?"</p>

<p>"The fellow that went into the blast-choke after
the dead man?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He is down with mountain fever, and
Myra says nothing but good nursing will save him.
Dick has got his story out of him at last; he is
Margaret Gannon's father."</p>

<p>"Humph! what a little world this is! I suppose
you will send Margaret right away?"</p>

<p>"I shall go with her to-morrow morning. I'll
tell Dick what you are going to do, and you can
come when you are ready."</p>

<p>The old man nodded acquiescence. "It'll be
better for you to go along; she'll be all broke up.
Want me to go and wire Dick?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you will. I should have asked the boy to
wait, but he was gone before I had opened the envelope.
Tell Dick to keep him alive at any cost,
and that we'll be there to-morrow evening."</p>

<p>When her father was gone, Constance sat down
to piece out the discoveries, comforting and harrowing,
of the foregone hour, and to set them over
against each other in a field which was as yet too
near to be retrospective. She tried to stand aside
for herself, and to see and consider only those to
whom her heart went out in loving compassion and
sympathy; but it was inevitable that she should
finally come to a re-reading of the letter taken from
its hiding-place in the photograph frame. She dwelt
upon it with a soft flush spreading slowly from neck
to cheek, reading it twice and yet once again before
she laid it in the little wall-pocket of a grate and
touched a match to it.</p>

<p>"For his sake and for mine," she said softly, as
she watched it shrivel and blacken in the flame.
"That is what I must do&mdash;burn my ships so that
I can't go back."</p>

<p>The charred wraith of the letter went up the
chimney in the expiring gasp of the flame, and
there was the sound of a familiar step in the corridor.
She went quickly to open the door for the
late visitor. It was Lansdale, come to say what
must be said on the eve of parting, and to ask for
his answer to a conditional plea made in a moment
when the consumptive's optimism had carried him
off his feet.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> periods of the scene-shifter, in life as in life's
mimicking on any stage, have fallen into disesteem.
In any flight of fancy or plodding journey of fact
these are flat countries to be traversed; interregnums
which, however replete with incident for the
actors themselves, are deemed alike unworthy of the
playwright's outworking or the chronicler's recording.
To the audience waiting beyond the footlights
these are mere breathing spaces of music-hastened
minutes standing for whatever lapses of days, weeks
or months the story of the play involves; but for
the scene-shifter they are gaps toil-filled, with fierce
strivings and wrestlings and doughty compellings of
the animate and inanimate perversities.</p>

<p>None the less, for the toiler behind the scenes
there are compensations, for the audience, the
<i>entr'acte</i> is a solution of continuity, more or less
skillfully bridged, according to the playwright's gift;
but the worker of transformations knows no break
in the action. For him the story of the play is
complete, marching evenly to its climax through
spoken line and drop-curtained interregnum.</p>

<p>The curtain has rung down upon an interior in
an apartment house. It is to rise upon a flashlight
picture of a summer night scene in a mountain-girt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
valley. The walls of the homelike interior
vanish, and in their stead dim reaches of the forest-clad
mountains suggest themselves. A stream tumbles
over the boulders in its bed with a hollow roar
hinting at canyoned plungings above; and on the
margin of it a quaking aspen blinks its many-lidded
eyes in the light of a camp fire.</p>

<p>Against the pillared background of forest, primeval
firs whose sombre greens become murky black
in the firelight, a campers' wagon is drawn up;
and the picket pins of the grazing horses are driven
in a grass grown extension of the glade to the right.
There is a silken whisper abroad in the night, rising
and falling upon the sound waves of the tumbling
stream: the voices of the trees as they call to each
other in the night wind pouring softly down from
the sky-pitched peaks.</p>

<p>The scene is set and the actors are in their places.
They are two men clad in flannel shirts and brown
duck overalls and shooting-coats. One of them is
bearded and bronzed, with the well-knit figure of
conscious strength. The other is of slighter frame,
and on his clean-shaven face the prolonged holiday
in the open is but now beginning to impress the
stamp of returning health and vigor. The bearded
man is on his back beside the fire, with his clasped
hands for a pillow and an extinct pipe between his
teeth. The clean-shaven one is propped against the
bole of a tree; his eyes are closed, and his pipe has
slipped from his fingers.</p>

<p>A brand falls into the glowing mass of embers, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
the sparks fly upward in a crackling shower. It is
the prompter's call-bell. The man reclining at the
tree-foot opens his eyes, and the bearded one sits up
and feels mechanically for the tobacco pouch.</p>

<p>"Here it is," says Lansdale. "I was just about
to fill up again when the realities slipped away.
It's astonishing how one can sleep overtime in these
upper levels."</p>

<p>The athletic one rises and stretches till his joints
crack. "Been asleep, have you? So have I.
There's no opiate in the world like a day's tramping
in the altitudes. Freshen you up any?"</p>

<p>"As to body, yes. But I've had a curious dream&mdash;if
it were a dream." Silence while the sob of the
river rises and falls on the night wind, and then a
half-hesitant query. "Jeffard, do you believe in presentiments?"</p>

<p>The bearded one is on his knees before the fire,
pressing a live coal into the bowl of his pipe, and the
answer is delayed.</p>

<p>"I don't know whether I do or not; I have never
had one."</p>

<p>"But you have known of others having them,
haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Of one other: but in that instance it was foreknowledge
rather than a foreboding. The presentiment
should have been mine; and I had none."</p>

<p>"Would you mind telling me about it?"</p>

<p>"No. It was while I was making the survey for
a logging railway in Quebec. I expected to be out
all summer, but in the middle of it the company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
called a halt and I went home. I hadn't wired or
written, but when I reached Hinsdale my father
was at the station to meet me. For three days my
mother had been insisting that I would come, and to
quiet her they had been meeting the trains. She
died the next evening."</p>

<p>"And you had no premonition?"</p>

<p>"None whatever. For a month or more I had
been beyond the reach of the mails; and I had left
her in her usual health. It was a bolt out of a clear
sky."</p>

<p>Again the brawling stream and the whispering
leaves fill the gap of silence; and as before, Lansdale
is the first to speak.</p>

<p>"I have always scouted such things, as sanity
seems to demand. Stories with any element of the
supernatural in them have never appealed to me because,
however well authenticated, they were always
stories, and never actual happenings in which I had
any part. But for the last day or two I've had a
growing sense of impending calamity, and I can't
shake it off."</p>

<p>There is the brusquerie of heartening in Jeffard's
rejoinder.</p>

<p>"Nonsense! It's only the imaginative part of
you kicking against the pricks of a longish holiday."</p>

<p>"That is ingenious, but I can't quite accept it.
I've eaten and slept with the imaginative fiend long
enough to be pretty well acquainted with his vagaries.
This is altogether different. It is precisely the feeling
you have had just before a storm; a sense of depression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
as intangible as darkness, but quite as real.
It was with me a few minutes ago when I fell asleep,
and the dream seemed to be a part of it."</p>

<p>"Oh, dreams," says the scoffer; "I thought they
had been accounted for by the dietists. I told you
that last batch of panbread held possibilities. But
go on and unload your dream. I'm shudder-proof."</p>

<p>Lansdale tells it circumstantially, keeping his pipe
alight in the periods.</p>

<p>"It didn't seem like a dream; at least, not in the
beginning of it. I was sitting here just as I am
now, and you were on your back over there, with the
pipe in your mouth. The surroundings were the
same, except that the fire was burning low. I remember
thinking that you must have fallen asleep, and
wondering why the pipe didn't fall and wake you.
After a time the roar of the stream seemed to quiet
down, and I heard the clink of horseshoes upon stone.
The sound came from across the stream, and as I
looked I saw a trail and a horseman coming down it.
It was all so real that I wondered why I hadn't noticed
the trail before. The man rode down to the
water's edge and made as if he would cross. I saw
him quite distinctly, and thought it curious, because
the fire was too low to give much light. He merely
glanced at the stream, and then turned his horse's
head and rode down the opposite bank. He passed
out of sight among the trees, and a moment later I
heard the horse's hoofs again, this time as if he were
on a bridge of poles."</p>

<p>Jeffard has been listening with attention no more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
than decently alert, but at this point he breaks in to
say: "You've been walking in your sleep. Go on."</p>

<p>"It was just here that the supernatural came in.
I told you that the man had passed out of sight, but
all at once I seemed to see him again. He was on
a corduroy bridge crossing the stream, and I saw
plainly what he did not,&mdash;that the bridge was unsafe,
and that a step or two would plunge him into
the torrent. I don't remember what followed, save
that I tried to call out, first to him and then to you;
but my voice seemed to be swallowed up in the thunder
of the water. There was a little gap filled with
fierce strugglings, and then I seemed to be here
again, lying by the wagon with a blanket over me;
and you were walking up and down with another man,&mdash;a
stranger. That is all; except that I tried to
tell you that you were wet through and would take
cold,&mdash;tried and couldn't, and awoke."</p>

<p>Jeffard has risen to put another log on the fire.</p>

<p>"It's the panbread," he says, with the air of one
who sweeps the board for a resetting of the pieces.
But after a little he adds: "I was wondering how
you came to know about the bridge. That is the
only unaccountable twist in it."</p>

<p>"Is there a bridge?"</p>

<p>"Yes; it's just below that farther clump of
aspens. But there is nothing the matter with it
that I could see. I noticed it while I was picketing
the horses."</p>

<p>"And is there a trail on the other side of the
stream?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span></p>

<p>"There is. There used to be a ford just here,
but it was dangerous, and we built the bridge."</p>

<p>"Then you have been here before?"</p>

<p>"Yes, many times. I spent the better half of a
summer and all of one winter in this valley. The
Midas is just below here. I meant to surprise you
to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>Lansdale's gaze is in the heart of the fire and his
voice is low. "Do you know, Henry, I'm rather
glad you didn't wait? Don't ask me why, because I
can't tell you in terms divisible by the realities. But
somehow the to-morrows don't seem to be assured."</p>

<p>"Oh, pshaw! that's your dream&mdash;and the panbread
its father. If you had talked that way a
month ago, when you were really living from hand
to mouth"&mdash;</p>

<p>Lansdale spreads his hands palms down and looks
at them.</p>

<p>"You promised me a new lease of life, Henry,
and you've given it me,&mdash;or the key to it. I didn't
believe it could be done, and my chief trouble in
those first days was the thought that you'd have to
bury me alone. And when we camped in a particularly
rocky spot, I used to wonder how you would
manage it."</p>

<p>Jeffard's smile is of grimness. "If you had mentioned
it, I could have helped you off with that
burden. These mountains are full of graves, ready-made;
prospect holes, where the better part of many
a man lies buried. Do you see that heap of earth
and stone over yonder?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span></p>

<p>Lansdale shades his eyes from the firelight and
looks and sees.</p>

<p>"That is one of them. Just behind that heap
there is a shaft with a windlass across it, and for six
weeks two men worked early and late digging a
hole,&mdash;which turned out to be an excellent well
when the water came in and stopped them."</p>

<p>"And the water was bitter," says Lansdale. "Did
you drink of it, Henry?"</p>

<p>"No; but the other man did, and he went mad."</p>

<p>Once more the stream and the sighing night wind
share the silence. For many days Lansdale has
been assuring himself that the golden moment for
speech of the helpful sort must ultimately be made
and not waited for. In the hour when he had consented
to Bartrow's urgings he had been given to see
his opportunity and had determined to grasp it,&mdash;had
made the determination the excuse for sharing
Jeffard's hospitality. He can look back upon that
resolve now and see that it was perfunctory; that
the prompting had been of duty and not at all of
love for the man. But the weeks of close companionship
have wrought more miracles than one, and
not the least among them is a great amazement
builded upon the daily renewal of Jeffard's loving-kindnesses.
For the man with the world-quarrel
has been a brother indeed; nurse, physician, kinsman,
and succoring friend; with the world-quarrel
put aside from the moment of outsetting, and with
apparently no object in life less worthy than that of
fighting a vicarious battle for a sick man. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
summary of it is humanizing, and the last upholdings
of the crust of reserve break down in the
warmth of it.</p>

<p>"May I speak as the spirit moves, Henry?"</p>

<p>"If you think I deserve it. Why shouldn't
you?"</p>

<p>"It is a question of obligations rather than of deservings,&mdash;my
obligations. No brother of my own
blood could have done more for me than you have."</p>

<p>"And you want to even it up?"</p>

<p>"No; but I want to tell you while I may that it
has come very near to me in these last few days.
At first I was inclined to make another query of it,
and to speculate as to your probable motive; but
latterly I've come to call it by its right name."</p>

<p>Jeffard shakes his head slowly, and removes his
pipe to say: "Don't make any more mistakes,
Lansdale. I'm neither better nor worse than I was
that night when I told you the story of the man and
his temptation. I know what you mean and what
you would say; but this experiment and its results&mdash;the
twenty odd pounds of flesh you have put on,
and the new lease of life they stand for&mdash;mean more
to me than they do to you."</p>

<p>"I don't begin to understand the drift of that,"
says Lansdale.</p>

<p>"No? I wonder if you would understand and
believe if I should tell you the truth; if I should
confess that my motive, so far as you are concerned,
is entirely selfish?"</p>

<p>"Since understanding implies belief, I shall have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
to say no to that. But you might try,&mdash;for your
own satisfaction."</p>

<p>"It's altogether unprofitable; but perhaps it's
your due. I'll have to go back a little to make it
clear. In the old days we were pretty good friends,
but I think you will admit that there have always
been reservations. You haven't known me and I
haven't known you as friends of the David and
Jonathan sort know each other. Isn't that so?"</p>

<p>Lansdale is constrained to say "Yes," wishing it
were otherwise.</p>

<p>Jeffard refills his pipe and fishes for another live
coal in the fire-fringe. The <i>g-r-r-rh</i> of the grazing
horses comes from the near-by glade, and again
the silence begins to grow. Suddenly he says:
"Let's drop it, Lansdale, and talk about something
else."</p>

<p>"No, go on; nothing you can say will efface the
brotherly fact."</p>

<p>"Very well,&mdash;if you will have it. You said you
were inclined to question my motive. It was more
than questionable; it was frankly selfish."</p>

<p>"Selfish? You'll have to spell it out large for
me. From my point of view it seems rather the
other way about. What had you to gain by saddling
yourself with the care of a sick man?"</p>

<p>"I can't put it in words&mdash;not without laying
myself open to the charge of playing to the gallery.
But let me state a fact and ask a question. A year
ago you thought it was all up with you, and you
didn't seem to care much. A few months later I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
found you fighting for your life like a shipwrecked
sailor with land in sight. What did it?"</p>

<p>That the lava-crust of reserve is altogether molten
is evinced in Lansdale's straightforward reply.</p>

<p>"Love,&mdash;love for a woman. I think you must
have known that."</p>

<p>"I did. That was why you were making the
desperate fight for life; and that is why we are here
to-night, you and I. I love the woman, too."</p>

<p>Lansdale shakes his head slowly, and an ineffable
smile is Jeffard's reward.</p>

<p>"And yet you call it selfishness, Henry. Man,
man! you have deliberately gone about to save my
life when another might have taken it!"</p>

<p>"I shall reap where I have sown," says Jeffard
steadily. "Latterly I have been living for one day,&mdash;the
day when I can take you back to her in the
good hope that she will forget what has been for the
sake of what I have tried to make possible."</p>

<p>Once more Lansdale's gaze is in the glowing heart
of the fire, and the light in his eyes is prophetic.</p>

<p>"Verily, you shall reap, Henry; but not in a field
where you have sown. Don't ask me how I know.
That's my secret. But out of all this will come
a thing not to be measured by your prefigurings.
You shall have your reward; but I crave mine, too.
Will you give it me?"</p>

<p>"If it be mine to give."</p>

<p>"It is. Do justice and love mercy, Henry.
That is the thing I've been trying to find words to
say to you all these weeks."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span></p>

<p>Jeffard lays the pipe aside and does not pretend
to misunderstand.</p>

<p>"Tell me what you would like to have me do."</p>

<p>"I think you must know: find the man who
drank of the bitter waters and went mad, and give
him back that which you have taken from him."</p>

<p>"Isn't there a possibility that I can do neither?"</p>

<p>"I can help you to do the first,&mdash;and for the
other I can only plead. I know what you would
say: that the man had forfeited his right; that he
tried to kill you; that by all the laws of man's inventing
this money is yours. But God's right and
your debt to your own manhood are above all these.
As your poor debtor, I'm privileged to ask large
things of you; can't you break the teeth of it and
shake yourself free of the money-dragon?"</p>

<p>Jeffard is afoot, tramping a monotonous sentry
beat between the wagon and the fire. His rejoinder
is a question.</p>

<p>"Do you know where James Garvin is to be
found?"</p>

<p>"I don't, but Bartrow does."</p>

<p>"Why didn't he tell me?"</p>

<p>"Because Dick is merciful. The man is a criminal,
and you could send him to the penitentiary."</p>

<p>"And Dick thought&mdash;and you have thought&mdash;that
I would prosecute him. It was the natural
inference, I suppose,&mdash;from your point of view.
The man who would rob his partner wouldn't stumble
over a little thing like that. Will it help you
to sleep the sounder if I say that vengeance isn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
in me?&mdash;wasn't in me even in the white heat
of it?"</p>

<p>Lansdale nods assent. "I'm on the asking hand,
and any concession is grateful. If you were vindictive
about it, I'm afraid the major contention would
be hopeless."</p>

<p>"But as it is you do not despair?"</p>

<p>"I am very far from despairing, Henry. You
spoke lightly of our friendship a little while ago,
and one time I should have agreed with you. But
I know you better now, and the incredibility of this
thing that you have done has been growing upon
me. It's the one misshapen column in a fair temple.
Won't you pull it down and set up another in its
place,&mdash;a clean-cut pillar of uprightness, which will
harmonize with the others?"</p>

<p>Jeffard stops short at the tree-bole, with his hand
on Lansdale's shoulder.</p>

<p>"It has taken me five weeks to find out why you
consented to come afield with me," he says. "It
was to say this, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Just that," says Lansdale, and his voice is the
voice of one pleading as a mother pleads. "Say
you will do it, Henry; if not for your own sake or
mine, for the sake of that which has brought us
together here."</p>

<p>Jeffard has turned away again, but he comes back
at that to stand before Garvin's advocate.</p>

<p>"It is a small thing you have asked, Lansdale,"
he says, after a time; "much smaller than you
think. The pillar isn't altogether as crooked as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
looks; there is something in the perspective. You
know how the old Greek builders used to set the
corner column out of the perpendicular to make it
appear plumb. We don't always do that; sometimes
we can't do it without bringing the whole structure
down about our ears. But in this case your critical
eye shall be satisfied. We'll go down to the mine
in the morning and use Denby's wire. If Bartrow
can find Garvin, you shall see how easily the dragon's
teeth may be broken. Is that what you wanted me
to say?"</p>

<p>Lansdale's answer is a quotation.</p>

<p>"'And it came to pass, when he had made an
end of speaking ... that the soul of Jonathan
was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan
loved him as his own soul.' I've seen my reward
and felt of it; and yours will come a little later,&mdash;in
a way you little dream of. Pass the tobacco,
and let's have another whiff or two before we turn
in. I'm too acutely thankful to be sleepy."</p>

<p>For a peaceful half-hour they sit before the glowing
embers, smoking placidly while their talk drifts
hither and yon over the spent sea of boyhood and
youth. It is a heartening half-hour, and at the end
of it Jeffard rises to get the blankets from the
wagon. Lansdale elects to sleep at his tree-root,
and he is rolling himself in his blanket when Jeffard
says:</p>

<p>"How about the presentiment? Have we tired
it out?"</p>

<p>Lansdale laughs softly. "It's gone," he says.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
"Perhaps it was nothing more than an upheaval of
conscience. I'm subject to that when I've anything
on my mind. Good-night, and God bless
you, Henry."</p>

<p>And so the curtain goes down upon the summer
night scene in the mountain-girt valley, with the
two men sleeping peacefully before the fire, and the
stars shining softly in the patch of velvety sky overhead.
The midnight ebb of the snow-fed stream
has set in, and the throbbing roll of the water drum
is muffled. The fire burns low. The whispering
leaves are stilled, and the wind slipping down from
the snow coifs, sinks to a sigh. The pinions of the
night are folded, and darkness and murmurous silence
wrap the mantle of invisibility around the camp in
the glade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is the gray dawn that lifts the curtain, and in
the little glade where the two men slept there are
three figures, dim and ghostly in the morning's
twilight. Two of them are afoot, heavy-eyed and
weary, tramping a slow-paced beat on the margin
of the tumbling stream. The third is a still shape
lying blanket-covered beside the wagon.</p>

<p>"Tell me about it, Denby," says one of the
watchers, and his voice breaks in the saying of it.
"I think I can bear it now. How did it happen?"</p>

<p>The master of men shakes his head. "I can't
tell you anything more than the bald fact, Jeffard.
I rode down the trail ahead of Higgins, and should
have forded the creek here, only I didn't want to
disturb you two. I went on to the bridge, and in
the act of crossing he ran down the bank on this
side, calling to me to go back. It was too late. I
had barely time to get free of the stirrups when we
were into it,&mdash;the two of us and the horse. It isn't
more than three or four feet deep, as you know, but
I knew it meant death if we went into the mill tail
below. I lost my grip and was gone when he grappled
me. I don't know yet how he came to save my
life and lose his own."</p>

<p>"It was to be," says Jeffard, brokenly. "When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
I reached you he was holding you up with one hand
and clinging to the bridge stringer with the other.
His weight and yours with the rush of the water
had pushed the timber down, and his head was
under."</p>

<p>Two other turns they make, and then Jeffard
says, with awe in his voice, "He knew about it
beforehand, Denby," and he tells Lansdale's dream.</p>

<p>Denby hears him through without interrupting,
but at the end of it he says, gently: "It wasn't a
dream. Higgins was overdue with the team from
Aspen, and I went out to see what had become of
him. I passed here on my way up the trail about
nine o'clock, and you were both asleep then. I had
crossed by the lower ford and found it pretty bad,
so I turned back from here and rode down to see
if the bridge was all right. He saw me and heard
me."</p>

<p>Jeffard's gesture is of unconvincement.</p>

<p>"That accounts for part of it," he says; "but
I shall always believe he foresaw his death and the
manner of it."</p>

<p>After that they pace up and down in silence
again, treading out the sorrowful watch until daylight
is fully come, bringing with it a team from the
mine and men to do what remains to be done. The
two stand apart until the men have done their
office, falling in to walk softly behind the wagon
on the short journey down the valley to the mine
settlement. On the way, Jeffard accounts for himself
briefly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span></p>

<p>"He was one of the two best friends I had in the
world," he says. "I had him out on a camping
holiday for his health, and he was gaining day by
day. We were counting upon dropping in on you
this morning, and now"&mdash;</p>

<p>"I know," says the master. "He gave his life
for mine, and it gets pretty near to me, too." And
thereafter they keep step with heads bowed and
eyes downcast, as those in whom sorrow has murdered
speech; and the bellowing stream at the trail-side
thunders a requiem for its victim.</p>

<p>The setting sun is crimsoning the eastern snow
caps while they are burying him on the plateau
above the mine settlement. An hour later, the
master of men and the master of the mine are met
together in the log cabin opposite the great gray
dump; in the cabin builded by Garvin, but which
now serves as the office of the superintendent of
the Midas. Sorrow still sits between, and Denby
would give place to it.</p>

<p>"Put it off till to-morrow, Jeffard," he says.
"Neither of us is fit to talk business to-night."</p>

<p>"No, it mustn't be put off. I gave him my promise,
and I mean to make it good while time
serves. Have you any one here who is competent
to witness a legal document?"</p>

<p>"Yes; Halsey is a notary public."</p>

<p>"Good. Sit down at that desk and draw up a
writing transferring my interest in the Midas to
Stephen Elliott and Richard Bartrow, trustees."</p>

<p>"What's that? Trustees for whom?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span></p>

<p>"For James Garvin."</p>

<p>The master of men leans back in his chair, his
eyes narrowing and the little frown of perplexity
radiating fan-like above them.</p>

<p>"Jeffard, do you mean to say that you are going
to step aside in favor of the man who tried to kill
you?"</p>

<p>"You may put it that way, if you choose. It
would have been done long ago if I had been able to
find the man."</p>

<p>"And you stepped into the breach a year ago
and secured his property for him because he had
put himself out of the running and couldn't?
You've touched me on the raw, Jeffard. It's my
business to size people up, and you have fairly outflanked
me. A blind man might have seen the
drift of it, but I didn't; I thought you had robbed
him. Why didn't you give it a name?"</p>

<p>"I had no thought of concealment until you
warned me. Garvin was a criminal in the eye of
the law, and the least I could do for him was to
turn the tide of public opinion in his favor."</p>

<p>"Well, you did it; but just the same, you might
have passed the word to me. It wouldn't have
gone any farther, and I should have felt a good bit
easier in my mind."</p>

<p>"Perhaps; but you will pardon me if I say that I
wasn't considering you in the matter. I knew better
than to defeat my own end. If I had told you
the truth at the time, you would not have believed
it; you would have struck hands with your own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
theory that Garvin had attempted to rob me, and
you would have talked and acted accordingly."</p>

<p>"What makes you say I wouldn't have believed
the truth?"</p>

<p>"It would have been merely a declaration of
intention at the time, and you would have said that
it didn't square with human nature as you know it.
Bartrow knew, and he went over to the majority.
But that is neither here nor there. Will you draw
up the writing?"</p>

<p>Denby goes to the desk and writes out the
transfer, following Jeffard's dictation. When it is
signed and acknowledged, Jeffard slips his final
anchor.</p>

<p>"I presume you will want to make a new operating
contract with the trustees, or with Garvin, and
in that case you will want to cancel the old one.
I haven't my copy of it with me, but I'll mail it to
you when I get back to Denver."</p>

<p>Denby is making a pretense of rummaging in the
pigeonholes of the desk to cover a small struggle
which has nothing to do with the superintendent's
files. When the struggle is fought to a finish, he
turns suddenly and holds out his hand.</p>

<p>"Jeffard, that night when we wrangled it out
up yonder on the old dump I said some things that
I shouldn't have said if you had seen fit to be a
little franker with me. Will you forget them?"</p>

<p>Jeffard takes the proffered hand and wrings it
gratefully. "Thank you for that, Denby," he
says; "it's timely. I feel as if I'd like to drop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
out and turn up on some other planet. This thing
has cost me pretty dear, one way with another."</p>

<p>"It'll come out all right in the end," asserts the
master; and then: "But you mustn't forget that
the cost of it is partly of your own incurring. It's
a rare failing, but there is such a thing as being too
close-mouthed. You've made out your case, after
a fashion, and I'm not going to appeal it; but your
postulate was wrong. Human nature is not as
incredulous of good intentions as the cynics would
make it out to be. You might have told a few of
us without imperilling Garvin."</p>

<p>"I meant to do it; as I say, I did tell Bartrow
that morning when I raced Garvin across the range
and into Aspen. But he and every one else drew
the other conclusion, and I was too stubborn to
plead my own cause. The stubbornness became a
mania with me after a time, and I had a fit of it
no longer ago than last night. I let Lansdale die
believing that he had argued me into promising to
make restitution. We were coming down here to-day
to set the thing in train, and, of course, he
would have learned the whole truth; but for one
night&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For one night you would let him have the comfort
of believing that he had brought it about," says
Denby, quickly. "That wasn't what you were
going to say, but it's the truth, and you know it.
I know the feel of it; you've reached the point
where you can get some sort of comfort out of holding
your finger in the fire. Suppose you begin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
right here and now to take a little saner view of
things. What are your plans?"</p>

<p>"I haven't any."</p>

<p>"Are you open to an offer?"</p>

<p>"From you?&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"Good. I'm unlucky enough to have some mining
property in Mexico, and I've got to go down
there and set it in order, or send some one to do it
for me. Will you go?"</p>

<p>Jeffard's reply is promptly acquiescent.</p>

<p>"Gladly; if you think I am competent."</p>

<p>"I don't think,&mdash;I know. Can you start at
short notice?"</p>

<p>"The sooner the better. I said I should like to
drop out and turn up on some other planet: that
will be the next thing to it."</p>

<p>From that the talk goes overland to the affairs of
a century-old silver mine in the Chihuahuan mountains,
and at the end of it Jeffard knows what is
to be done and how he is to go about the doing of it.
Denby yawns and looks at his watch.</p>

<p>"It's bedtime," he says. "Shall we consider it
settled and go over to the bunk-shack?"</p>

<p>"I have a letter to write," says Jeffard. "Don't
wait for me."</p>

<p>"All right. You'll find what you need in the
desk,&mdash;top drawer on the right. Come over when
you get ready," and the promoter leaves his late
owner in possession of the superintendent's office.</p>

<p>Judging from the number of false starts and torn
sheets, the writing of the letter proves to be no easy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
matter; but it is begun, continued, and ended at
length, and Jeffard sits back to read it over.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Bartrow</span>:</p>

<p>"When this reaches you, you will have had my
telegram of to-day telling you all there is to tell
about Lansdale's death. You must forgive me if I
don't repeat myself here. It is too new a wound&mdash;and
too deep&mdash;to bear probing, even with a pen.</p>

<p>"What I have to say in this letter will probably
surprise you. Last night, in our last talk together,
Lansdale told me that you know Garvin's whereabouts.
Acting upon that information, I have to-night
executed a transfer of the Midas to yourself
and Stephen Elliott, trustees for Garvin. By agreement
with Denby, I cancel my working contract with
him, and you, or Garvin, can make another for the
unexpired portion of the year on the same terms,&mdash;which
is Denby's due. You will find the accrued
earnings of the mine from the day of my first settlement
with Denby deposited in the Denver bank in
an account which I opened some months ago in the
names of yourself and Elliott, trustees. Out of the
earnings I have withheld my wages as a workman in
the mine last winter, and a moderate charge for
caretaking since.</p>

<p>"That is all I have to say, I think, unless I add
that you are partly responsible for the delay in Garvin's
reinstatement. If you had trusted me sufficiently
to tell me what you told Lansdale, it would
have saved time and money, inasmuch as I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
spared neither in the effort to trace Garvin. I told
you the truth that morning in Leadville, but it
seems that your loyalty wasn't quite equal to the
strain put upon it by public rumor. I don't blame
you greatly. I know I had done what a man may
to forfeit the respect of his friends. But I made
the mistake of taking it for granted that you and
Lansdale, and possibly one other, would still give
me credit for common honesty, and when I found
that you didn't it made me bitter, and I'll be frank
enough to say that I haven't gotten over it yet."</p></blockquote>

<p>The letter pauses with the little outflash of resentment,
and he takes the pen to sign it. But in the
act he adds another paragraph.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"That is putting it rather harshly, and just now
I'm not in the mood to quarrel with any one; and
least of all with you. I am going away to be gone
indefinitely, and I don't want to give you a buffet
by way of leave-taking. But the fact remains. If
you can admit it and still believe that the old-time
friendship is yet alive in me, I wish you would.
And if you dare take word from me to Miss Elliott,
I'd be glad if you would say to her that my sorrow
for what has happened is second only to hers."</p></blockquote>

<p>The letter is signed, sealed, and addressed, and he
drops it into the mail-box. The lamp is flaring in
the night wind sifting in through the loosened chinking,
and he extinguishes it and goes out to tramp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
himself weary in the little cleared space which had
once been Garvin's dooryard. It is a year and a
day since he wore out the midwatch of that other
summer night on the eve of the forthfaring from the
valley of dry bones, and he recalls it and the impassioned
outburst which went to the ending of it.
Again he turns his face toward the far-away city
of the plain, but this time his eyes are dim when
the reiterant thought slips into speech. "God help
me!" he says. "How can I ever go to her and tell
her that I have failed!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> news of Lansdale's death came with the
shock of the unexpected to the dwellers in the metamorphosed
cabin on the upslope of Topeka Mountain,
albeit no one of the three of them had ventured to
hope for anything more than a reprieve as the outcome
of the jaunt afield. But the manner of his
death at the time when the reprieve seemed well
assured was responsible for the shock and its sorrowful
aftermath; and if Constance grieved more than
Bartrow or her cousin, it was only for the reason
that the heart of compassion knows best the bitterness
of infruition.</p>

<p>"It's a miserably comfortless saying to offer you,
Connie, dear, but we must try to believe it is for the
best," said Myra, finding Constance re-reading Jeffard's
telegram by the light of her bedroom lamp.</p>

<p>Constance put her arms about her cousin's neck,
and the heart of compassion overflowed. "'For
unto every one that hath shall be given, but from
him that hath not shall be taken away even that
which he hath,'" she sobbed. "Of all the things
he had set his heart upon life was the least,&mdash;was
only the means to an end: and even that was taken
from him."</p>

<p>"No, not taken, Connie; he gave it, and gave it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
freely. He did for another what his friend was
trying to do for him."</p>

<p>At the reference to Jeffard, Constance went to
stand before the crackling fire of fir-splinters on the
hearth. After a time she said: "Do you suppose
Mr. Jeffard will come here to tell us about it?"</p>

<p>Myra's answer was a query.</p>

<p>"Does he know you are here?"</p>

<p>"No, I think not."</p>

<p>"Then he will be more likely to go to Denver."</p>

<p>Connie's gaze was in the fire, and she swerved
aside from the straight path of inference.</p>

<p>"He will write to Dick," she said. "I should
like to read the letter when it comes, if I may."</p>

<p>Myra promised, and so it rested; but when Jeffard's
letter came, and Bartrow had shared its
astounding news with his wife, Myra was for rescinding
her promise.</p>

<p>"I don't know why she shouldn't read it," said
Dick. "She has always been more or less interested
in him, and it will do her a whole lot of good to
know that we were all off wrong. Jeffard's little
slap at me hits her, too, but she won't mind that."</p>

<p>"No," said Myra; "I was thinking of something
else,&mdash;something quite different."</p>

<p>"Is it sayable?"</p>

<p>They were sitting on the steps of the extended
porch. The night-shift was at work in the Myriad
below, and the rattle and clank of a dump-car coming
out postponed her answer. When the clangor
subsided she glanced over her shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span></p>

<p>"She can't hear," said Bartrow. "She's in the
sitting-room reading to Uncle Steve."</p>

<p>"I'm not sure that it is sayable, Dick. But for
the last two days I've been wondering if we weren't
mistaken about something else, too,&mdash;about Connie's
feeling for Mr. Lansdale. She is sorry, but not
quite in the way I expected she would be."</p>

<p>"What has that got to do with Jeffard's letter?"
demanded the downright one. His transplantings
of perspicacity were not yet sufficiently acclimated
to bloom out of season.</p>

<p>"Nothing, perhaps." She gave it up as unspeakable,
and went to the details of the business affair.
"Shall you tell Garvin at once?"</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>"How fortunate it is that he and Uncle Stephen
came in to-day."</p>

<p>"Yes. They were staked for another month, and
I didn't look for them until they were driven in
for more grub. But Garvin says the old man is
about played out. He's too old. He can't stand
the pick and shovel in this altitude at his age.
We'll have to talk him out of it and run him back
to Denver some way or other."</p>

<p>"Can't you make this trusteeship an excuse? If
Garvin needed a guardian at first, he will doubtless
need one now."</p>

<p>Bartrow nodded thoughtfully. Another car was
coming out, and he waited until the crash of the
falling ore had come and gone.</p>

<p>"Jeffard knew what he was about all the time;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
knew it when he wrote this letter just as well as
he did when he shouldered the curse of it to keep
a possible lynching party from hanging Garvin.
That's why he put it in trust. He knew Garvin
had gone daft and thrown it away once, and he was
afraid he might do it again."</p>

<p>"Will he?" asked the wife.</p>

<p>"I guess not. I believe he has learned his lesson.
More than that, Jim's as soft as mush on the side
next the old man. If I can make out to tie Uncle
Steve's welfare up in the deal, Garvin will come to
the front like a man."</p>

<p>"Where is Garvin now?"</p>

<p>"He is down at the bunk-house."</p>

<p>Myra rose. "I suppose you want to get it over
with. Let me have the letter, if you won't need it."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"Carry Connie off to her room and keep her busy
with this while you and Uncle Stephen fight it out
with the new millionaire," she said. "I don't envy
you your part of it."</p>

<p>Bartrow laughed, and the transplantings put forth
a late shoot.</p>

<p>"Come to think of it, I don't know as I envy
you yours," he retorted. "She's all broke up about
Uncle Steve's health and Lansdale's death now, and
she'll have a fit when she finds out how she has been
piling it on to Jeffard when he didn't deserve it."</p>

<p>It was an hour later, and the day-men smoking
on the porch of the boarding-house had gone to bed,
when the husband and wife met again midway of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
the path leading up from the shaft-house of the
Myriad to the metamorphosed cabin. Bartrow had
walked down to the boarding-house with Garvin,
and Myra's impatience had sent her down the path
to meet him. Dick gave her his arm up the steep
ascent, and drew her to a seat on the lowest of the
porch steps.</p>

<p>"Where is Connie?" he inquired, anticipating an
avalanche of questions, out of which he would have
to dig his way without fear of interruption.</p>

<p>"She is with her father. Begin at the beginning,
and tell me all about it. What did Garvin say?
Is he going to be sensible?"</p>

<p>"There isn't so much to tell as there might be,"
Dick said, smothering a mighty prompting to tell
the major fact first. "Garvin took it very sensibly,
though a body could see that the lamplight was a
good bit too strong for his eyes. He had to try
three or four times before he could speak, and then
all he could say was 'Thirds, Steve, thirds.'"</p>

<p>"'Thirds?' What did he mean by that?"</p>

<p>Bartrow hesitated for a moment, as a gunner who
would make sure of the priming before he jerks the
lanyard.</p>

<p>"Did it ever occur to you that any one else besides
Garvin and Jeffard might be interested in the
Midas?"</p>

<p>"Why, no!"</p>

<p>"It didn't to me. I don't know why, but I
never thought of it, though I knew well enough that
Jim never in all his life went prospecting on a grub-stake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
of his own providing. He didn't that summer
three years ago when he drove the tunnel on the
Midas."</p>

<p>Myra's lips were dry, and she had to moisten
them to say, "Who was it, Dick?"</p>

<p>"Who should it be but our good old Uncle Steve?
Of course, he'd forgotten all about it, and there he
stood, wringing Garvin's hand and trying to congratulate
him; and Jim hanging on to the back of
his chair and saying, 'Thirds, Steve, I say thirds.'
Garvin made him understand at last, and then the
old man melted down into his chair and put his face
in his hands. When he took it out again it was to
look up and say, 'You're right, Jim; of course it's
thirds,' and then he asked me where Jeffard was."</p>

<p>Myra's voice was unsteady, but she made shift to
say what there was to be said; and Bartrow went
on.</p>

<p>"After a bit we got down to business and straightened
things out. A third interest in the Midas is
to be set apart for Jeffard, to be rammed down his
throat when we find him, whether he will or no.
Uncle Steve will go back to Denver and set up
housekeeping again; and Garvin,&mdash;but that's the
funny part of the whole shooting-match. Garvin
refuses to touch a dollar of the money as owner; insists
on leaving it in trust, just as it is now; and
made me sit down there and then and write his
will."</p>

<p>An outcoming car of ore drowned Myra's exclamation
of surprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span></p>

<p>"Fact," said Bartrow. "He reserves an income
to be paid to him at Uncle Steve's discretion and
mine, and at his death his third goes,&mdash;to whom,
do you suppose?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, I can't imagine,&mdash;unless it is to Connie."</p>

<p>"Not much! It's to be held in trust for Margaret
Gannon's children."</p>

<p>"For Margaret,&mdash;why, she hasn't any children!
And besides, he doesn't know her!"</p>

<p>"Don't you fool yourself. He knows she hasn't
any children, but he's living in hopes. I told you
there was something between them from the way
Garvin turned in and nursed the old blacksmith
before Margaret came. You wouldn't believe it,
because they both played the total-stranger act; but
that was one time when I got ahead of you, wasn't
it?"</p>

<p>"Yes; go on."</p>

<p>"Well, I made out the will, 'I, James Garvin,
being of sound mind,' and so on; and Uncle Steve
and I witnessed it. But on the way down to the
bunk-shanty just now I pinned Garvin up against
the wall and made him tell me why. He knew
Margaret when she was in the Bijou, and asked her
to marry him. She was honest enough even then to
refuse him. It made me want to weep when I remembered
how she had been mixed up with Jeffard."</p>

<p>Myra was silent for a full minute, and when she
spoke it was out of the depths of a contrite heart.</p>

<p>"I made you believe that, Dick, against your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
will; and you were right, after all. Mr. Jeffard
was only trying to help Connie's poor people through
Margaret, though why he should do that when he
was withholding a fortune from Uncle Stephen is
still a mystery."</p>

<p>"That is as simple as twice two," said the husband.
"Didn't I tell you? Garvin had no occasion
to tell him who his grub-staker was in the first
place, and no chance to do it afterward. Jeffard
didn't know,&mdash;doesn't know yet."</p>

<p>Myra went silent again, this time for more than a
minute.</p>

<p>"I have learned something, too, Dick; but I am
not sure that I ought to tell it," she said, after the
interval.</p>

<p>"I can wait," said Bartrow cheerfully. "I've
had a full meal of double-back-action surprises as it
is."</p>

<p>"This isn't a surprise; or it wouldn't be if we
hadn't been taking too much for granted. I tolled
Connie off to her room with the letter, as I said I
would; and she&mdash;she had a fit, as you prophesied."</p>

<p>"Of course," says Dick. "It hurts her more
than anything to make a miscue on the charitable
side."</p>

<p>"Yes, but"&mdash;</p>

<p>"But what?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you sometime, Dick, but not now. It
is too pitiful."</p>

<p>"I can wait," said Bartrow again; and his lack of
curiosity drove her into the thick of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you knew you'd want to do something,&mdash;as
I do, only I don't know how. Isn't it pretty clear
that Mr. Jeffard cares a great deal for Connie?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know about that. What makes you
think so?" says the obvious one.</p>

<p>"A good many little things; some word or two
that Margaret has let slip, for one of them. How
otherwise would you explain his eagerness to help
Connie?"</p>

<p>"On general principles, I guess. She's plenty
good enough to warrant it."</p>

<p>"Yes, but it wasn't 'general principles' in Mr.
Jeffard's case. He is in love with Connie, and"&mdash;</p>

<p>"And she doesn't care for him. Is that it?"</p>

<p>"No, it isn't it; she does care for him. I fairly
shocked it out of her with the letter, and that is why
I oughtn't to tell it, even to you. It is too pitiful!"</p>

<p>Bartrow shook his head in cheerful density.
"Your philosophy's too deep for me. If they are
both of one mind, as you say, I don't see where the
pity comes in. Jeffard isn't half good enough for
her, of course; he made a bally idiot of himself a
year ago. But if she can forget that, I'm sure we
ought to."</p>

<p>"I wasn't thinking of that. But don't you see
how impossible this Midas tangle makes it? He
won't take his third, you may be very sure of that;
and when he finds out that Connie has a daughter's
share in one of the other thirds, it will seal his lips
for all time. People would say that he gave up his
share only to marry hers."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span></p>

<p>Bartrow got upon his feet and helped her to rise.
"You'll take cold sitting out here in the ten-thousand-foot
night," he said; and on the top step of
the porch-flight she had his refutation of her latest
assertion.</p>

<p>"You say people would talk. Doesn't it strike
you that Jeffard is the one man in a thousand who
will mount and ride regardless?&mdash;who will smile
and snap his fingers at public opinion? That's just
what he's been doing all along, and he'll do it again
if he feels like it. Let's go in and congratulate the
good old uncle while we wait."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> day train from the south ran into the early
winter twilight at Acequia, and into the night at
Littleton; and the arc stars of the city, resplendent
with frosty aureoles, were brightly scintillant when
Jeffard gave his hand-bag to the porter and passed
out through the gate at the Union Depot. By telegraphic
prearrangement, he was to meet Denby in
Denver to make his report upon the Chihuahuan
silver mine; but when he made inquiry at the hotel
he was not sorry to find that the promoter had not
yet arrived. It is a far cry from Santa Rosalia to
Denver; as far as from the beginning of the seventeenth
century to the end of the nineteenth; and he
was grateful for a little breathing space in which
to synchronize himself.</p>

<p>But after dinner, and a cigar burned frugally in
the great rotunda, where the faces of all the comers
and goers were unfamiliar, the homesickness of the
returned exile came upon him, and he went out to
grapple with it in the open air. Faring absently
from street to street, with his hands thrust into his
overcoat pockets and memory plowing its furrow
deep in a field which had lain fallow through many
toil-filled weeks, he presently found himself drifting
by squares and street-crossings toward Capitol Hill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
and out and beyond to a broad avenue and past a
house with a veranda in front and a deep-bayed
window at the side. There were lights in the house,
and an air of owner's occupancy about the place;
and on the veranda a big man was tramping solidly
up and down, with the red spark at the end of his
cigar appearing and disappearing as he passed and
repassed the windows.</p>

<p>Jeffard saw the man and saw him not. The
memory-plow had gone deeper, and the winter night
changed places with a June morning, with the sun
shining aslant on the wide veranda, and a young
woman in a belted house-gown with loose sleeves tiptoeing
on the arm of a clumsy chair while she
caught up the new growth of a climbing rose. Just
here the plow began to tear up rootlets well-buried
but still sensitive; and Jeffard turned about abruptly
and set his face cityward.</p>

<p>But once again in the region of tall buildings and
peopled sidewalks, the thought of the crowded lobby
and the loneliness of it assailed him afresh, and
he changed his course again, being careful to go at
right angles to the broad avenue with its house of
recollection. A little way beyond the peopled walks
the church bells began to ring out clear and melodious
on the frosty air, and he remembered what the
uncalendared journey had made him forget; that it
was Sunday. Pacing thoughtfully, with the transit-hum
of the city behind him and the quiet house-streets
ahead, and the plow still shearing the sod
of the fallow field, he wondered if Constance Elliott<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
would be among the churchgoers. It was an upflash
of the old cynicism which prompted the retort
that it was improbable; that the Christianity for
which she stood was not found in the churches. But
the Puritan blood in him rose up in protest at that,
and in the rebound the open doors of a church on
the opposite side of the way beckoned him.</p>

<p>He crossed the street and entered. The organist
was playing the voluntary, and a smart young man
with a tuberose in his buttonhole held up the finger
of invitation.</p>

<p>"Not too far forward," Jeffard whispered; but
the young man seemed not to have heard, since he
led the way up the broad centre aisle to a pew far
beyond the strangers' precinct.</p>

<p>The pew was unoccupied, and Jeffard went deep
into it, meaning to be well out of the way of later
comers. But when the finale of the voluntary
merged by harmonious transpositions into the key
of the opening hymn, the other sittings in the pew
were still untaken, and Jeffard congratulated himself.
There be times when partial isolation, even in
a sparsely filled church, is grateful; and the furrows
in the fallow field were still smoking from their
recent upturning.</p>

<p>Jeffard stood in the hymn-singing, and bowed his
head at the prayer, not so much in reverence as in
deference to time, place, and encompassments. Since
the shearing of the plowshare filled his ears, the
words of the beseeching were lost to him, but he was
sufficiently alive to his surroundings to know that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
the pew filled quietly at the beginning of the prayer;
and sufficiently reserved afterward to deny himself
so much as a glance aside at his nearest neighbor.</p>

<p>How long he would have sat staring abstractedly
at the pictured window beyond the choir must remain
a matter for conjecture. The minister had
given out the psalm, and Jeffard stood up with the
others. Whereupon he saw of necessity that his
neighbor was a woman, so small that the trimmings
on her modest walking hat came barely to his
shoulder; saw this, and a moment later was looking
down into a pair of steadfast gray eyes, deep-welled
and eloquent, as she handed him an open
book with the leaf turned down.</p>

<p>He took the book mechanically, with mute thanks,
but afterward he saw and heard nothing for which
the evensong in St. Cyril's-in-the-Desert could justly
be held responsible, being lifted to a seventh heaven
of ecstasy far more real than that depicted in
the glowing periods of the preacher. He made the
most of it, knowing that it would presently vanish,
and that he should have to come to earth again.
And not by whispered word or sign of recognition
would he mar the beatitude of it. Only once, when
he put aside the book she had given him and looked
on with her, did he suffer himself to do more than to
enjoy silently and to the full the sweet pleasure of
her nearness.</p>

<p>Under the circumstances it was not singular that
his by-glancings did not go beyond her; and that
Dick Bartrow's hearty handclasp and stage-whisper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
greeting at the close of the service should take him
by surprise. This he endured as one in a dream;
also the introduction to a radiant young woman with
whom Bartrow presently led the way into the stream
of decorously jostling outgoers pouring down the
great aisle. That left Jeffard to follow with the
small one; and he was still groping his way through
the speechless ravishment of it when they overtook
the Bartrows on the sidewalk. Dick promptly
broke the spell.</p>

<p>"Well, well!" he began. "Nothing surprises me
any more; otherwise I should say you are about the
last man on top of earth that I'd expect to run up
against in church. Don't say 'same here,' because
I do go when I'm made to. Where in the forty-five
states and odd territories did you drop from?"</p>

<p>"Not from any one of them," laughed Jeffard;
and Myra remarked that Connie's hand was still on
his arm. "I am just up from Old Mexico."</p>

<p>"And you made a straight shoot for a church&mdash;for
our church and our pew. Good boy! You
knew right where to find us on a Sunday evening,
didn't you?"</p>

<p>Jeffard laughed again. Since a time unremembered
of him it had not been so easy to laugh and be
glad.</p>

<p>"Don't believe him, Mrs. Bartrow," he protested.
"My motive was a little mixed, I'll confess, but it
was altogether better than that. I was passing, and
it occurred to me that I hadn't seen the inside of
an American church for a long time."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span></p>

<p>"Or of any other kind, I'll be bound," Bartrow
amended; and then, in a spirit of sheer ruthlessness:
"Why don't you say something, Connie? Call him
down and make him tell the truth about it."</p>

<p>"You don't give any one a chance to say anything,"
retorts the quiet one, with a summer-lightning
flash of the old mock-antagonism. And then to
Jeffard: "We are all very glad to see you again,
Mr. Jeffard. Will you be in town long?"</p>

<p>Bartrow took the words out of his mouth and made
answer for him.</p>

<p>"Of course he will; he is going to settle down
and be home-folks&mdash;aren't you, Jeffard? Fall in
and let's walk to where we can wrestle it out without
freezing. It's colder than ordinary charity standing
here."</p>

<p>Now the way to his hotel lay behind him and Jeffard
hesitated. Whereupon Bartrow turned with a
laugh derisive.</p>

<p>"Come on, you two. Have you forgotten the formula,
Jeffard? I'll prompt you, and you can say it
over after me. 'Miss Elliott, may I have the pleasure
of seeing you'&mdash;"</p>

<p>Myra pounced upon the mocker and dragged him
away; and Constance cut in swiftly.</p>

<p>"You mustn't mind what Dick says. He calls
going to church 'dissipation,' and he is never quite
responsible afterward. Won't you go home with us,
Mr. Jeffard?"</p>

<p>Jeffard murmured something about a hotel and an
appointment, but he had been waiting only for an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
intimation that he was forgiven. So they went on
together, walking briskly, as the frosty night demanded,
but they were not able to overtake the twain
in advance. For a time they were both tongue-tied,
and for a wonder it was the man who first rose superior
to the entanglements of memory. But he was
careful to choose the safest of commonplaces for a
topic. They were ascending Capitol Hill, and by
way of a beginning he said, "Are you living in
this part of the city now?"</p>

<p>"Yes; in the old place on Colfax. Dick ran across
the owner in California last autumn and bought it."</p>

<p>"It is a very pleasant place," Jeffard ventured,
still determined to keep on ground of the safest.</p>

<p>"Do you know it?" she said, quickly.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes;&mdash;er&mdash;that is, I know where it is. I
passed it one morning a long time ago."</p>

<p>"While we were living there?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Silence again for one entire square and part of
another. Then she said, "How did you know it was
our house?"</p>

<p>He laid hold of his courage and told the truth.
"I met your father a block or two down the avenue
and I was hoping I might come upon the place where
you lived. I found it. You were on the veranda,
tying up the new shoots of a climbing rose."</p>

<p>"My 'Marechal Niel,'" she said. "It is dead
now; they let it freeze last winter."</p>

<p>He held his peace for a time, but the rejoinder
strove for speech, and had it, finally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span></p>

<p>"The memory of it lives," he said. "I shall always
see you as I saw you that morning, whatever comes
between. You had on some sort of a dress that reminded
me of the old Greek draperies, and you were
standing on the arm of a big chair."</p>

<p>They were at the gate, and she let him open it for
her. Bartrow and Myra were waiting for them at
the veranda step. He realized that the ground was
no longer safe, and would have taken his leave at the
door. But Dick protested vigorously.</p>

<p>"No, you don't&mdash;drop out again like a ship in a
fog. We've been laying for you, Uncle Steve and
I, ever since you absconded last summer, and you
don't get away this time without taking your medicine.
Run him in there, Connie, and hang on to
him while I go get my slippers and a cigar."</p>

<p>"There" was the cozy library, with a soft-coal fire
burning cheerily in the grate, and the book-lined
walls inviting enough to beckon any homeless one.
But Jeffard was far beyond any outreaching of encompassments
inviting or repellent. Constance drew
up a chair for him before the fire, but he stood at the
back of it and looked down upon her.</p>

<p>"Miss Elliott, there is something that I should like
to tell you about&mdash;if it is far enough in the past,"
he said, when they were alone.</p>

<p>She was sitting with clasped hands, and there was
a look in her eyes in the swift upglancing that he
could not fathom. So he waited for her to give him
leave.</p>

<p>"Is it about Mr. Lansdale?" she asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes. I was with him up to the last, and I
thought that&mdash;that you might like to know what I
can tell you."</p>

<p>She gave him liberty, and he told the story of
the jaunt afield, dwelling chiefly on the day-to-day
improvement in Lansdale's health, and stumbling a
little when he came to speak of their last evening
together.</p>

<p>"It was a hard blow for me," he said, at the end
of it, and his voice was low and unsteady with emotion.
"You know what had gone before&mdash;what I
had lost and couldn't regain; and having failed at
all points I had hoped to succeed in this: to bring
him back to you sound and well. And when the
possibility was fairly within reach it was taken out
of my hands forever."</p>

<p>She was silent for a little time, fighting a sharp
battle with reticence new-born and masterful. When
she spoke it was as one who is constrained to walk
with bare feet in a thorny path of frankness.</p>

<p>"To bring him back to me, you say; and in your
letter to Dick you said that your sorrow was second
only to mine. Was he not your friend, as well as
mine?"</p>

<p>"I loved him," said Jeffard, simply; "but not as
you did."</p>

<p>Again the struggle was upon her, and for a moment
she thought that the sound of Dick's returning
footsteps would be the signal of a blessed release.
But the heart of sincerity would not be denied.</p>

<p>"Let there be no more misunderstandings," she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
said, bravely. "We have all wronged you so deeply
that you have a right to know the truth. Mr. Lansdale
was my friend&mdash;as he was yours."</p>

<p>"But he meant to be more," Jeffard persisted&mdash;"and
if he had come back with the courage of health
to help him say it, you would not have denied him."</p>

<p>She made a little gesture of dissent.</p>

<p>"His health had nothing to do with it. And&mdash;and
he said it before he went away."</p>

<p>Jeffard smiled. "You have halved the bitterness
of it for me&mdash;as you would have lessened my
reward if I had succeeded in bringing him back
alive and well. My motive was mixed, as most
human promptings are,&mdash;I can see that now,&mdash;but
the better part of it was a desire to prove to
you that I could do it for your sake. My debt to
you is so large that nothing short of self-effacement
can ever discharge it."</p>

<p>"How can you say that!" she burst out.
"Wasn't I one of the three who ought to have believed
in you?&mdash;the one who promised and failed
and made it harder for you at every turn? You
owe me nothing but scorn."</p>

<p>He contradicted her gravely. "I owe you everything
that has been saved out of the wreck of the
man who once sat beside you in the theatre and
found fault with the world for his own shortcomings.
You are remorseful now because you think
you misjudged me; but you must believe me when
I tell you that it was my love for you that saved
me, at the end of the ends,&mdash;that kept me from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
doing precisely what you thought I had done. It
was a fearful temptation. Garvin had fairly tossed
the thing into the abyss."</p>

<p>"I know; but it was only a temptation, and you
did not yield to it."</p>

<p>"No; I was able to put it aside in the strength
born of four words of yours. At a time when I
had forgotten God and so was willing to think
that He had forgotten me, you said 'I believe in
you.' You remember it?"</p>

<p>She nodded assent, looking up with shining eyes
to say, "Don't make me ashamed that I hadn't the
strength to go on believing in you."</p>

<p>"Don't say that. You have nothing to regret.
My silence was the price of Garvin's safety, at first,
and I knew what the cost would be when I determined
to pay it. Later on the fault was mine; but
then I found that I had unconsciously been counting
upon blind loyalty; yours, and Dick's, and Lansdale's;&mdash;counting
upon it after I had done everything
to make it impossible. I had told Dick in
the beginning, and I tried to tell Lansdale. Dick
wanted to believe in me,&mdash;has wanted to all along,
I think,&mdash;but Lansdale had drawn his own conclusions,
and he made my explanation fit them. It
hurt, and I gave place to bitterness."</p>

<p>"And yet you would have saved him for&mdash;for&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For that which I couldn't have myself. Yes;
but you know the motive."</p>

<p>She met his gaze with a new light shining in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
steadfast eyes. "I am not worthy," she said,
softly; and he went quickly to stand beside her.</p>

<p>"You are worthy; worthy of the best that any
man can give you, Constance. How little I have
to offer you, beyond a love that was strong enough
to stand aside for the sake of your happiness, you
know. Ever since that afternoon when you strove
with me for my own soul I've been living on your
compassion, and it is very sweet&mdash;but I want
more. May I hope to win more&mdash;in time?"</p>

<p>She shook her head, and his heart stopped beating.
But it came alive again with a tumultuous
bound at the words of the soft-spoken reply.</p>

<p>"You won it long ago, so long that I've forgotten
when and how. And it's strong, too, like
yours. I've tried hard enough to starve it, but it
has lived&mdash;lived on nothing."</p>

<p>She was sitting in a low willow rocker, and the
distance between them was altogether impossible.
So he went down on one knee and put his arms
about her; and but for his manhood would have put
his face in her bosom and wept.</p>

<p>"Do you really mean that, Constance?" he said,
when he had drunk his fill from the deep wells in
the loving eyes.</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"In spite of what you believed I had done to
Garvin, and of what you believed I was capable of
doing with Margaret?"</p>

<p>"In spite of everything. Wasn't it dreadful?"</p>

<p>"It was&mdash;" There was no superlative strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
enough, though he sought for it painfully and with
tears. "God help me, sweetheart, I believe I shall
go mad with the joy of it." And having said that,
speech forsook him, and the silence that is golden
came between. After a while she broke it to say:</p>

<p>"Dick is good, isn't he?&mdash;to be so long finding
his slippers and the cigar."</p>

<p>"Dick is a man and a brother. I wonder if
we can persuade him to give me a place on the
Myriad."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't take it."</p>

<p>"Why wouldn't I?"</p>

<p>"Because you own an undivided third of a richer
mine than the Little Myriad, and&mdash;and you are
going to marry another third," she said, with sweet
audacity.</p>

<p>There was a hassock convenient, and he drew it
up to sit at her feet.</p>

<p>"Break it as gently as you can," he entreated.
"My cup is too full to hold much more. Besides,
I've been in Mexico for the last three months, and
nothing happens there."</p>

<p>"It's the Midas," she explained, beginning in
the midst. "You saved it for Garvin, but he was
only a half-owner."</p>

<p>"And the other?"</p>

<p>"Was my father. When it came to the apportionment
they both said 'thirds,' and that is what
poppa and Dick are waiting to say to you now."</p>

<p>He found his feet rather unsteadily.</p>

<p>"I can't take it," he said; "you know I can't.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
It would be too much like taking a reward for an
act of simple justice. Moreover, I have my reward,
and it isn't to be spoken of in the same day with
any Midas of them all. I'll go and tell them so."</p>

<p>She rose and stood beside him, lifting the loving
eyes to his. The soft glow of the firelight made a
golden aureole of the red-brown hair, and the sweet
lips were tremulous.</p>

<p>"If you must, Henry. But loving-kindness isn't
always in giving and serving and relinquishing.
My father has his ideal of justice, too, and so has
James Garvin. But for you, they say, the Midas
would never have been found, or, having been
found, would straightway have been lost again. I
know the money is nothing to you,&mdash;to us two, who
have so much; but won't you make a little concession,
a little sacrifice of pride,&mdash;for their sakes,
Henry?"</p>

<p>He took her face between his hands and bent to
kiss the lips of pleading.</p>

<p>"Not for their sakes, nor for all the world beside,
my beloved; but always and always for yours.
Come; let us go together."</p>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

Gutenberg-tm License.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
